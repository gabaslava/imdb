# imdb

This is an ongoing project.
My ultimate goal is to build a model recognizing a personal sentiment for a particular movie based on the 
information that can be gathered on the web.
The sample is 1007 movies I've seen and each of it was labeled with either a negative or positive sentiment. 
So far I've gathered a dataset of imdb.com information for each movie and prepared another dataset of movie reviews, 
the latter was naturally expanded since one movie can have several critic reviews. This way I've more than doubled my dataset.
.ipynb files attached in this repository are of codes I've written for web scraping while collecting the data, and for 
some analysis on the data while preparing it for a model to learn from.
