"better than I expected I went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by Scoop. Happily, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little bit. Its nothing heavy, nothing deep  and not anywhere as good as any number of real Allen masterpieces  but its also completely enjoyable as a light, bantering comedy. Theres something kind of simple and sweet about it. Cute was the word I heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show. It doesnt feel like Allen set out to create a masterpiece here, it feels like he wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to just about everything Hollywood is producing, Allens stuff has a tendency to charm. Even the fluffy stuff. These days its just refreshing to go to a movie made by an actual human being.",True
"Once you let this film sink in, it turns out to be very rewarding If it was never new, and it never gets old, then its a folk song.The Coen brothers have worked together over the past couple of decades delivering some inspiring work. Their films are extremely varied (ranging from dark comedies to westerns or thrillers) and that is why people rank their films so differently according to their own genre preferences. What these films tend to have in common is that they focus on an unfortunate main character (the Coen brothers dont seem to be too interested in successful characters) and they also include a lot of quirky characters. The Coens are also great at writing interesting characters that despite being unpleasant at times still capture our attention, and they also include a lot of dark and sharp humor. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those films where we are forced to follow an unpleasant guy in the course of a week and somehow hope he recovers and achieves his goal. This is a film that you probably enjoy more when you think about it once its over or on a rewatch because its philosophical and sad, but rewarding none the less if you stick through it. It is also open to many readings and interpretations. You can think of this as being an honest film about someone who doesnt achieve his dreams. Weve been saturated with so many films that focus on following our dreams and never giving up on them, but it is rare to see a film focusing on someone who doesnt achieve them. Like Llewyn, we sometimes throw away other possibilities for success because we are too blinded on pursuing our own thing. That is exactly what happens here (and in this way it differs from A Serious Man where the main character suffers misfortune from things that he cant control). Llewyn couldve listened and taken good advice, but hes so narcissistic and blinded by his own ambition that he misses several good opportunities. Another way you can read this film, and this is the one that worked best for me, is that Llewyn is learning to cope with the loss of his partner. He was a better singer when he wasnt on his own and now that he has lost his partner he doesnt seem to know what to do next. He is a tortured artist struggling to cope with grief. Its as if the Coens were admitting that they wouldnt know how to make films without each other. They inspire one another and that is where their success relies. Perhaps if something would happen to one of them they would feel like Llewyn, lost and unable to move on. This is just brilliant filmmaking and the Coens prove once again that they are on top of their game.The film takes place in the course of one week as we follow a struggling folk singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaacs) across Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. He has recently released a solo album that isnt selling. With no money and no apartment, Llewyn spends his days jumping from couch to couch at friends houses while performing small gigs at local Cafes. One of the places he crashes in is at fellow musicians, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jeans (Carey Mulligan) apartment. Llewyn isnt really a guy anyone wants to be around much, but he continues to pursue his dream of becoming a solo artist. In a way hes his own worst enemy as many of the obstacles he faces are his own doing. Im not a fan of depressing films, but somehow the Coens captured my attention through their smart script and beautifully constructed film. The gray cinematography is gorgeous and really sets the melancholic tone of the film. Somehow despite not liking Llewyn, Isaacs manages to portray his character so well that we do root for him and want him to succeed. Its an impressive film that succeeds thanks to Isaacs heartfelt performance. We also get to meet some of the quirky characters that the Coens always include in their films. John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund were the chosen ones this time around and they both added the dark humor in this otherwise sad and melancholic film. The soundtrack is also a lot of fun to listen too and Isaacs has a great voice.",False
"By the Sea Placed in charge of his teen nephew after his brother passes away, a morose handyman confronts inner demons and reevaluates his life in this downbeat drama starring Casey Affleck. The film gets off to a solid start as we witness Afflecks humdrum existence and the moody residents who he has to deal with. As the film progresses though, it adopts a stream of consciousness narrative style, flipping back and forth between Afflecks memories and the present day as he processes his brothers death and his new role in his nephews life. This provides an emotional wallop at one point as we discover just what happened to his doting daughters, but generally speaking, the flipping back and forth in time is unhelpful, subtracting from the immediacy of the drama unfolding. The film also grows repetitive as the same issues are debated between uncle and nephew time and time again. There are some really good touches late in the piece though (Affleck imaging his daughters; a confrontation with Michelle Williams) and the entire project is shot with thought and consideration; the way Affleck is only ever visible in the background when we first see the grownup nephew at an ice rink works very well. Still, it is hard not to expect a little more from an Oscar winning film and though solid a movie as it is, it would be interesting to see the film play out in chronological order instead.",True
"Growing up as a lesson of life This movie is great. I mean, really. Thats what every boy dreams of  becoming an adult overnight! Its absolutely gorgeous to see Tom Hanks performance  thats real acting, it requires a lot to play this part as genuinely and cordial as he did. The message is so clear and so honest. The nostalgic edge is of such profound significance to the story. Its about the differences between being a kid and being an adult. Its about two very different perceptions of the same world that surrounds us. Its just us and how we make the best out of every day of our lives, and all it needs is to see the world through the eyes of a kid. A kid perceives all the things differently, with much more native and modest simplicity  the keystone to imagination and magic, the keystone to cherish the daily miracles in our lives. This movie has a deep and very pervasive message. It has so much charm and vitality mingled with nostalgia and witchcraft. One of those movies I enjoyed watching when I was a kid. Recommended.",False
"Another Part Two That Doesnt Live Up to The Original I was looking forward to seeing what Oliver Stone & the ensemble he got together could do with an updated version of an even greedier Wall Street that was gambling with obscene amounts of money & making their own rules that the S.E.C. didnt do anything about or even try to understand it seems.I was very disappointed. This follow up didnt fare well against the original...which is almost always the case. But with Stone directing again & Douglas in again...I thought this may have a chance. Some part 2s are just laughable...I guess they make money or they would stop doing them. The big exception of course was The Godfather part 2.Anyway  this movie just didnt have the snap, crackle & pop of the original. And I think the movie spent way too much time on the Jake & Winnie relationship played by Shia La Beouf (wasnt that Glenn Campbells name in the original True Grit, well....maybe it was La Beef) & Carey Mulligan. By the way...very sad about Campbells Alzheimers admission.When I saw this movie I knew that La Beouf had been in a lot of Hollywood movies & must have been well thought of....but it was the 1st movie I had seen him in. I thought he did OK with the part he was given. But Mulligan was such an annoying character as Winnie....or was it Whiney? Every time she was in a scene it was like fingernails on a blackboard. Did anybody else feel that way about Mulligans performance? And as others have said...the ending was just not very good.",False
"A cookbook turned fairy tale Usually when I read a book, I am disappointed by the movie; there is so much more in the written word than can be put on screen.  And when I see a movie I never want to read the book afterwards.  This was the first movie that I read the book after seeing the movie; Como Agua Para Chocolate is THAT good a movie!  And the book is WONDERFUL! The fairy tale aspect of this movie is told subtly, but with a strong Hispanic sense of mysticism you have the evil (step)mother, the heroine as Virgin Mary, who has magical powers, unrequited love, the unobtainable prince, and other classic fairy tale elements.  This combines with the real elements of the Mexican Revolution and old world family practices revolving around family relations, martimony, and most of all cooking.  Food plays a major role in this movie, but even more so in the book. I recommend both the book and the movie.",False
"Caged birds sing Theres an air of romance surrounding wayward boys, particularly in the French tradition, where they tend to be poetic as well as mischievous. In The Chorus, Christophe Barratier draws on this tradition and adds some lovely vocal sounds. The Chorus is about an internat or reform school where a new principal who writes music tames his young charges, some naughty, some just abandoned, by teaching them to sing in a boys chorus. The school director, Rachin (sounds like Nurse Ratched), François Berléand (of Jacquots The School of Flesh), is a prissy sadist who preaches a philosophy of instant punishment for all real or imagined wrongdoing (actionreaction); but when the new principal, Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) shows up with a soft approach to his classes and his supervisory duties, he finds allies among the faculty and staff.The Chorus advances the frequently screened theory that delinquent kids are better charmed than chastened; that if you can find a positive activity they excel in, the misbehavior will die out.Barratier has had good success with his young actors. The most important boy is the tête dange (head of an angel), tall, fairhaired Morhange (Jean Baptiste Maunier), whos often in trouble and refuses to join the choir, till Mathieu catches him singing by himself and discovers his star soloist. Morhanges voice possesses not only a rich natural musicality but the haunting purity only boy sopranos have. Morhange has the most attractive mother, and Mathieus success in encouraging the boys singing makes the pudgy, bald man fantasize romance with her  thus incidentally clearing himself of the suspicion of pedophilia that tends to haunt any allboys school setting. Mathieus romantic dream is futile, and he humbly fades away at the storys end, like some Gallic pied piper of boy sopranodom.The Chorus takes place in postwar France and its topic and look establish immediate links with a bevy of seminal French films. Wayward French boys turn up in boarding schools that are places of both repression and refuge, as you can see in Jean Vigos school revolution in Zero for Conduct (1933). The beloved textbook of the French badboy tradition is Alain Fourniers Le Grand Meaulnes (The Wanderer), which was notably filmed by Jean Pierre Albicocco in 1967. The tradition becomes more autobiographical in Truffauts 1959 400 Blows, which introduced the directors alter ego, Jean Pierre Léaud; and in Malles moving and longcontemplated memoir of a boarding school in wartime, Au Revoir les Enfants (1987). Jean Cocteau mythologized a badboy idol who haunted him all his life in the Dargélos of Les Enfants Terribles (1950), made into yet another classic film by Jean Pierre Melville. This whole idea has remaining traces in the feral youth Gaspard Ulliel plays in André Téchinés recent Strayed. The Chorus, it is true, is a relatively conventional entry; except for adding music, it rides upon, rather than transcends, the tradition. But its a warm story with much charm and little pretension.Barratier himself is a talented musician who, like Mathieu, has drifted into other things. A trained classical guitarist, he won several international competitions after studying at the prestigious École Normale de Musique in Paris, and played professionally for several years. But in 1991 he joined Galatée films to train under his uncle, the renowned actor, producer and writer Jacques Perrin  who bookends The Chorus as a Morhange who has grown up into a famous classical conductor. For the next decade Barratier was an associate producer and collaborated with Perrin on Children of Lumière, Microcosmos, Himalaya and Winged Migration. Now he has turned his hand to fiction and directed his own film, with success. There is a risk of preciosity and sweetness, mostly avoided by the dryness of both Mathieu and Rachin as characters, as well as the surviving wickedness of the boys, especially an arch badboy, Mondain (Grégory Gatignol). The point of view is Mathieus and the mature Morhanges, so the film doesnt go as deep into the boys psyches as it goes into their voice boxes.The director is well connected. Hes the son of film actress Eva Simonet and besides his uncle his grandparents were also theater people. The Chorus was top box office in France after its release in March 2004. The French critical reception was pretty mixed, and the films been reviled by some in the United States as (in one writers words) unbelievably inane, saccharine, and derivative; all smooth, nutrientfree clichés. Even thumbsup king Roger Ebert didnt like it: this feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film, he wrote. Wheres the quirkiness, the nuance, the deeper levels? But its really a cleanly made, simple, humanistic, and satisfying little film with far less pandering than its critics claim, and whether we like it or not, its the French Best Foreign Oscar entry, and the little chorus is likely to perform  Vois sur ton chemin on Awards night (if their voices havent changed). The relatively minimal miseenscène and the period setting link it more with its classic film antecedents than with the overproduced Very Long Engagement (Jeunets films Oscar nominations are for décor and photography). Derivative and conventionally themed? Yes. Barratier has acknowledged The Choruss inspiration in an earlier film, La Cage aux Rossignols (The Nightingales Cage, 1945), which has the same premise  and anyone can name a long list of movies about teachers who charm their wayward flock. None of them feels  or sounds  quite like this movie, though. And the boys do their own singing: the tête dange really has the voix dange. American reviewers, missing the nuances, plug Les Choristes into Mr. Hollands Opus or Dead Poets Society and find it stereotypically schmaltzy. The gentler French critics dont see those crude comparisons and are able to call it un beau film and find in it a satisfying example of cinéma populaire. We can too if we open up to it.",False
"Casey Afflecks best work to date Casey Afflecks has officially come into his own. Fantastic performance! Brad Pitts performance complex and stunning as usual. Brad does not shy away from the real roles and proves time and time again what a brilliant actor he is. Roger Deakins shots are stunning, capturing the true beauty that lies within the Canadian rockies. The artistic shots through the old style glass is fantastic. Score is very unorthodox yet amazingly effective.The only downside to the film many say is the running time, but I admire that Andrew allowed for the performances of the actors to be the showcase. Many scenes with not a lot of background music, just the intense performances.",True
"A Classic Woody picture, one of my favorites of his Woody Allens Purple Rose of Cairo is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. He combines drama, comedy and even a little bit fiction (people jumping out of movie screens into the real world). Its a great story involving a woman with marital problems played superbly by Mia Farrow. Here Farrow gives one of her best performances, much better than she was in a film i recently viewed called Shadows and Fog. Jeff Daniels is also good in his role as the movie character who comes into the real world, as well as the actor who plays that role. This is by far one of the most complex yet well written Woody Allen flicks. All the performances are good as well as the direction and writing, almost everything is perfect. A mustsee for any Woody fan.10/10 #60 on my list of alltime favorite films",False
"Shorn of the irrelevant, this is beautiful, touching, real Frances Ha (2012)I liked this film in a kind of interested, warm way as it got going. Its black and white simplicity and its regular people both appeal on the most normal level. The more I watched, however, and the more I absorbed the brilliance of the performance by leading actress playing Frances (Greta Gerwig), I became entranced and stunned. This is a great film. A great independent film, without production pretensions, but held together perfectly within its means.This is worth making clear—the film makes a virtue of its simple approach. Youll never feel like its technically compromised. The photography is a subtle, smart black and white. Theres even one scene near the end where two people are talking in bed and they chose to use the very minimum of light, so you just barely see their faces. For a long deep conversation. Gorgeous, and effective.Its Gerwig who steals the movie, for sure. And she helped write the really sparkling, believable, clever but never tooclever script. Its brilliant stuff. Brilliant. She hits a note of fast transparency, a totally right dialog and delivery. Way harder than it seems.And the character she plays, Frances, is one of those lovable types where things dont go quite right even with all the best intentions. Most of us identify with that all too well. We have our better selves and we have the reality of where those good intentions have gotten us. And yet she perseveres. She puts up with strange but not unfriendly people around her in one apartment after another, and we get a glimpse of young New Yorkers with all their minor pretensions. Searing and funny and touching.Dont be put off by the weird title (the one mistake in making the film) or by the beginning and its slow, restrained monochrome. The film makes the most of it all and is terrific.",True
"Disturbing, Stunning, Daring and Dark Michael Haneke the austere Austrian director of such critically acclaimed films as Funny Games, Code Unknown and The Piano Teacher has created in Caché (Hidden) his finest film to date.Starring Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche the film is a taut and tense personal thriller, which examines important subjects such as guilt and responsibility in the context of western comfort.Georges and Anne are a happily married middle class couple who both work in the arts. The balance of their lives is suddenly disturbed when they begin to receive video cassettes seemingly surveying the exterior of their home. Anne is quite dismissive of the tape but immediately Georges believes there is a sinister element to the tape. Soon they receive more tapes and disturbing drawings. As Georges fears for the safety of his family he suddenly has to confront his past and allow his wife to learn the hidden secrets of his past.Hanekes film plays on one level like a common thriller, but it has much deeper psychological echoes as the hero George is revealed not to be quite the upstanding family man his family believed him to be. As his wife struggles to come to terms with the revelations their entire comfortable existence disintegrates.Haneke is not just interested in creating a thriller however and the auteur expertly dissects George and Annes bourgeois life and implicates them both in the treatment by western culture of the east and the third world.Acting in the film is terrific. Daniel Auteuil is simply excellent in his role, the actor manages to explore his character enough to make us forget it is a portrayal. Juliette Binoche as his wife initially seems not to be at the center of the film, but the stunning actress manages to place herself at the emotional center of the film as the wife and mother.Expert supporting roles are provided by Maurice Benichiou, Annie Girardot and Nathalie Richard among others.Caché is at once an intriguing thriller and a wonderful examination of guilt and responsibility in a very modern context.",False
"Enjoy It For What It Is This story is a lighthearted adventure comedy. I too am guilty of being one of those Wes Anderson fans who salivate over all the small details but while watching this I quickly detached myself from the director and his style and previous work and just let The Life Aquatic take me along. And thats what you have to do. Its different from his other stuff in that its more plot driven. There are some wonderful characters but they have to deal more with outside complications than internal struggles. It is similar in tone and style to Robert Altmans M*A*S*H, what with all the juggling of fighting and death (serious themes dealt with in an objective comedic manner). Theres also some Fellini moments (it was mostly filmed at Cinecitta). I loved it. Dont go into this film as a biased hipster Wes Anderson fan, clean the slate and take it with an open mind. Its certainly sillier than Rushmore or Tenenbaums, but its just as ambitious and exponentially courageous with shots and tone. To reiterate: more action oriented, funny as all get out, and quite possibly the funnest Ive had in a theater all year.",True
"Intriguing, investing, with a great screenplay and a fantastic performance at its core Sports films... Not a huge fan of them, and dont see them much because of the predictability of them. However, one cannot deny the impact that some have, like for example in recent years The Fighter and Aronofskys The Wrestler. Moneyball can now join them and is among the best films of the year.The film is always intriguing, and Aaron Sorkin (whose screenplay for The Social Network was last years best) is to be congratulated for this. Its his wonderful script that gives the film the energy. What also helps is the lack of predictability. Sure, one cant seem to hope for an experimental sports film, since this is based on a true story. However, Sorkin, as well as the director, always keeps things refreshing and interesting without becoming repetitive and stale. The dialogue is brilliant of course, and the lack of field action makes it even more involving so when the important ball scene comes along it makes an impact. The other big driving factor is Brad Pitt, who has had an incredible year. His performance in The Tree of Life is already among his finest work, and now this joins it as well. He portrays all of the character traits with such versatility and charisma. A great and satisfying protagonist. Overall, I was incredibly pleased with this. It is to this day the best adapted screenplay of the year, and not surprisingly Pitt is my win in both categories for both of his films.",True
"The Debts potential is spoiled by sloppy writing Is the truth actually what happened or what everyone believes happened? The Debt attempts to answer the question and almost succeeds if it were not for some very poor screen writing. It is 1966 and Mossad has finally tracked down the infamous Birkenau surgeon, Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen). Dr. Vogel is very high on the list of Nazi war criminals the Israelis are hunting down because of the atrocities he committed at his concentration camp. He would deliberately blind children to see if he could change eye color and cut off hands and feet and reattach them on the wrong limbs to see what happened.The spy team assigned to kidnap him and bring him to justice are team leader Stephan (Marton Csokas), David (Sam Worthington), and Rachel (Jessica Chastain). Their story is told in flashback and the first half of it is absolutely riveting. Rachel poses as a woman with fertility issues and becomes a patient of Dr. Vogel who is hiding as an OBGYN in the Soviet sector of East Berlin. The tension during the examination room scenes are the highlight of the film with both Rachel and the doctor verbally maneuvering to ensure the other person is who they think they are.After a convincing action sequence, the story abruptly turns from a kidnap/escape scenario into a hostage situation. This is one of the points where the film just falls apart. Mossad and their agents are the best in the entire world at their art. There is no way such highly trained agents would fall victim to and resort to the amateur hour theatrics which come with the hostage sequence. The script is riddled with illogical and bizarre events which only occur during the films most important sequences for some reason.Fast forward to 1997 and now older Rachel (Helen Mirren) is at her daughters book release party which describes the teams successful mission to Berlin all those years ago. Older Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) is also around for the recollections. The 1997 scenes are adeptly written and filmed, especially scenes with Mirren. Tom Wilkerson is just along for the ride. Unfortunately, the movies climax is one of the most preposterous situations a decent film has been saddled with. It is so ridiculous that a two hour meeting with the writers would still not convince me this was the best way to resolve the storys actions and issues. The mood and atmosphere are destroyed and the audience collectively shook their heads in disbelief at the mockery on screen.Screenwriters Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman (X Men: First Class, Kick Ass), and Peter Straughan (The Men Who Stare at Goats) adapted this screenplay from an earlier film. The Debts first hour is quite good with adept flow from 1997 to 1966 and the truly suspenseful scenes between Chastain and Christensen. However, their handling of the hostage situation and the absurd climax are what really hurt this film and makes the audience shake their heads with the Oh, what might have been lament.",False
"There is a reason why they are referred to as the greatest....From my understanding, before this film was made, Martin Scorsese, arguably Americas greatest filmmaker, was at the end of his rope. He was about to call it quits. His good friend, arguably Americas greatest film actor, Robert De Niro, approached him with a book he had read. The title of the book was Raging Bull. After some coaxing, Robert finally convinced his friend to do the film, and it resulted in a MASTERPIECE!!!!!
Raging Bull is the story of former boxing middleweight champion Jake La Motta, and his penchant for selfdestruction. La Motta is not in the least a nice guy. He is well, a jerk, who eventually drives any and everyone who has ever cared about him out of his life. He evolved from a lean, trim boxer to an overweight loser who owns a night club.This film currently ranks on AF Is 100 Greatest Movies at #24, and for very good reason. It contains arguably THE GREATEST acting performance in the history of cinema, by arguably the greatest actor in the history of cinema, directed by arguably the greatest director in the history of cinema. But together, nothing needs to be argued, they are the greatest tag team in the history of cinema. Robert De Niro is flawless, superb, excellent, amazing, any positive adjective is warranted by his performance. There is a reason why they call him the greatest actor. This is it. (also Taxi Driver) Naturally, Scorseses direction is flawless, and Thelma Schoonmakers editing will pretty much speak for itself. The blackandwhite(or tinted monochrome) was an ingenious touch, similar to William Friedkins gunshot at the very end of The French Connection. It is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, if it were a woman I could only beg to drink its bathwater. Joe Pesci is excellent as Jakes brother Joey, as is Cathy Moriarty as Jakes long suffering wife. It is sad when you realize that De Niro will never act that great again, but you find solace in the fact that he once did. He is maybe my favorite actor, Scorsese maybe my favorite director, and I only hope to have a millionth of the impact theyve had on film. Far superior to Rocky, even though Rocky is very good and contains maybe the most inspirational theme song ever.This film was criminally robbed of 1980s Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, by Ordinary People, another one of those dysfunctional family dramas. The Academy has since lost a huge amount of credibility, but I find solace in the fact that they honored De Niro with an award for Best Actor, in a performance that warrants two of them and makes me want to shine his shoes.The film gets nothing less than a 10. It was voted the film of the 1980s decade. I agree wholeheartedly.Scorsese and De Niro forever.",True
"Dark And Twisted, Full Of Great Visual Storytelling Dark and twisted, David Finchers stylish new mystery thriller was derived from Gillian Flynns intriguingly slick tale from her complex and suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck, Gone Girl boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario. Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes Gone Girl a movie full of great visual storytelling.",True
"Unforgettable I saw Ordinary People when I was very young and had a very difficult time with the storyline.However, even then I think I knew I was watching something simply remarkable. Even after all these years, its impact has not lessened, which I guess is a mark of an incredible movie. The movie is among the most disturbing Ive ever viewed and the performances, at least to me, are among the best. I cant imagine viewing this movie without feeling absolutely drained afterwards and I think I may have been a bit to young to fully appreciate it, but I cant imagine giving this anything but a 10, it was absolutely flawless in its storytelling.I do think though, that a certain element of maturity is needed to view this, there are few I know who have not been touched or upset by the story and if one is to young or just not in the right mood to handle the heaviness(as I wasnt at the time),they may not be able to fully appreciate it. I still know people who cannot sit through this and I understand why but I hope this movie will be viewed by many who can handle it, its impact is fierce, all the performances are incredible and Mary Tyler Moores performance is among the best of any female lead ever.",False
"With patience it is a very effective thriller whose plot problems are covered by a great director and a strong cast Max thinks his day is looking up when he gets a beautiful fare who gives him a tip and her business card when she gets out. Resting on his laurels, Max nearly misses his next fare; Vincent, in LA for just one night to close out 5 deals, get signatures and then fly out by 6am and he offers Max a few hundred dollars to taxi him around for the night and then drop him at the airport. Max agrees and takes him to the first stop, only to discover that Vincents job is actually to kill a list of 5 people and, now that Max has witnessed one killing, Vincent has no choice but to keep him with him.I loved this film; there is no point in trying to hide that fact, but I am not blind to the problems that it has: too many reviewers have either loved it without exception or overly criticised it. The plot has holes  there, Ive said it. The plot relies on some actions that dont ring true and other times rely on coincidences or just write things in to move the plot. However this is not a massive problem because it is still very enjoyable and gripping and its other strengths cover these problems. Of course, even with the holes it is still very enjoyable but demands your patience because, although it is tense, it isnt a roller coaster for the vast majority of the time. It has very fast moments but a lot of it is talky and patient  not a problem for me, but I can see why some multiplexers may have had itchy feet waiting for action. However even with this patience, the film is still very tense  helped by some very sudden moments of violence that come out of nowhere and help put the audience on edge. Much was made in Heat of key moments where opposite characters find common ground and in this film it is the opposite but done to similarly interesting effect. Here Max and Vincent are opposites who get under each others skins over the course of the night; their relationship is very strange and I think the script does well to bring this across even if it is hard to understand at times (part of this is their relationship getting tied up in some of the plot weaknesses).A big part of the plot problems being covered is due to the strong direction from Mann, who can shoot a city like nobody else. As others have said, the flyovers look great but for me the surprise was to see Mann add digital film to his cannon. This allows him to mix very rough, intimate shots with film to bring the audience in closer. I also noticed that he seemed to do very close angles and frames with proper film as well, all increasing the feel of being there and intimately involved. Of course, on top of this we still had Manns usual shooting of LA at night  fluorescent lighting, empty streets and so on  nothing new but it is still very effective and great to look at. If it werent for the very heavy cast involved here then Mann would be the main star of the film but, as it is, his direction is just part of the film pulling together to produce the goods.The cast is impressive and those who have come on the basis of Cruise alone will be surprised to find so many well known faces who are very able. Cruise wants an Oscar and he has done several of the Oscar tricks to get one  his most recent attempt here is to play totally against type. He does it pretty well, making for a convincing cold killer on the surface but still able to reveal an empty core when he is pushed. If he had been allowed to do this more then maybe he would have been more impressive but he isnt and the end result is just a good performance. Of course it doesnt help that Cruise has to play opposite Jamie Foxx delivering one of his most assured performances yet. Based on seeing him in stuff like Booty Call and his own comedy show, I was worried when I saw him due to star in this movie but it turns out that he can act! In fact he dominates the film with a quiet role that runs a gauntlet of emotions while Cruise mostly sits in cold killer mode, meaning that, in most scenes, Foxx is the one we are watching. The support cast is surprisingly deep and the amount of familiar faces makes some moments of violence all the more unexpected. While none of them are really given the time to shine, there are quality turns from Smith, Berg, Mc Gill, Hall, Henley and Ruffalo and it gives the (albeit false) impression of an allstar ensemble; although why Jason Stratham bothered to turn out for the one day of shooting he must have done for the airport scene is beyond me. Overall this is a very effective film. The atmosphere is just right and is helped by the script, the cast and the director  all combining to provide a patient pace that still manages to be very tense and exciting. Manns direction is great, mixing film with digital to good effect and Cruise is very good playing against type with a good support cast of wellknown faces.However the genuine surprise of the film is Jamie Foxx; better known for clichéd ethnic comedy roles, he steps up here and just about steals every scene he is in.",False
"Wonderful, gentle and very funny I loved the first series and was over the moon when I heard that these comedy legends were getting together again.They work so well together and in my opinion bring out the best in each other. The fact that they play a slightly altered version of themselves is so clever and so believable that Im certain some viewers will be entirely taken in by some of the racier elements of the story. In fact Im sure both actors will have had some quite serious discussions with their families to set the record straight.Loved the scenery, the real sense of Italy, the fabulous foods and above all the hilarious backandforth between Rob and Steve.Cant wait for the next series!",True
"A Fascinating Gem The Fountain is one fascinating film. I dont think theres enough words to describe what its like. After watching the film, Ive read several different interpretations and can only conclude that dont make a decision on what youve read, simply watch the film. Its a unique moviewatching experience.Aronofsky took me by complete surprise. I loved his Requiem for a Dream but I did not expect him to come up with something so different. Man, is that a big difference, not only in content but also in technique and pretty much everything. All I knew beforehand was that the film was a science fiction and that it starred Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz (actors whom I like). After watching it, I can safely say that The Fountain is much more than just a science fiction flick.I wont mention much of the plot as I do not want to ruin the experience by giving any spoilers. I would love to discuss the film with people who have already seen it. Aronofsky uses of symbolism, colour, and spectacular visuals to tell a story of life, death, love and rebirth. The visuals are simply breathtaking and the special effects are phenomenal. The use of different camera angles is particularly excellent as it gives the viewer (well at least me) the feel of the moving time and space. He cleverly uses lighting and colour to distinguish between the atmosphere of the different times as he does with the zoomlens. And, of course the soundtrack which is very underused but beautifully noticeable.Hugh Jackman is terrific in a multidimensional character and Rachel Weisz is phenomenal. Shes particularly outstanding as she plays her part with a subtle intensity. Ellen Burstyn has a smaller role but she is splendid to watch.Its really difficult to describe what the experience is like in just a few words. I havent yet understood every single aspect of The Fountain and am going to be rewatching it, but it does stay in mind long after the end credits have rolled. Its a complex theme but the basis is simple. It wont be liked by many as so many of it is left to interpretation with a lot of questions but for me its fascinating and is all a moviewatching experience should be.",True
"The fascination of slowness This must be the slowest movie Ive ever seen, and I was completely fascinated: slowly moving things on screen, a slowly moving camera, a main character who walks and talks slowly, and last but not least, a slowly developing story. In a time when everything has to go faster and faster, this film just takes its time.Cheyenne as a character could have been created by Tim Burton: a weird, lovable outsider who doesnt seem to belong to this world.About Sean Penns mumbling: English is not my first language, but I didnt think it was that bad. For me, it wasnt harder to understand Cheyenne than any of the other characters.",False
"A Film of True Humanity : Comedy in the Face of Hardship It has been 9 weeks now since Intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters. I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I dont overstating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors & countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored. Intouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as naïve as it may sound, the universality of humanity. The story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen. The audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippes life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter. Again, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc. The audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris. On paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. Its approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of best movie of the year. I cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored. PS  I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director, screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way The Departed did for Infernal Affairs.",False
"A Time Machine Trip Back To The Texas Summer Of 1976I graduated in 1976 from a high school in North Dallas and this entire movie is so spot on its scary. It is my favorite film. Ive seen it hundreds of times and every time its like watching it for the first time. Only someone that was there and lived through those days could have directed such a movie. I drove a 70 dark blue Chevelle SS 454 with a 4speed, over 400 HP and all of the goodies Wooderson described. Starting that car up, listening to the roar of that engine and burning out in 1st gear while in a thick cloud of blue smoke in front of the high school at 3PM while wasted......doing over 80MPH in 2nd gear....oh yea! I feel sorry for the teenagers today that drive the limp wrist fluffs of metal that pass themselves off as cars these days. I was a stoner like Pickford smoking weed nonstop. Some mentioned that the heavy drug use was not too common. Well, at our school it was beyond common. Before school, during school (in the bathroom and football field) and after school. Our school had a smoking area outside the cafeteria where everyone went to light up. The opening scene with Aerosmith Sweet Emotion slowly building up and Pickford driving his Goat and girlfriend in the school parking lot kills me every time. I cannot imagine a better opening scene for the movie. That was pure genius. The funny thing is Linklater did not show getting licks from the coach or the principal. For all the uninitiated back then all a coach or an asst. principal had to say was Smith, I want to see you back at my office now. Our coach had a paddle he personally made that he kept on his wall over his desk. It had about 30 holes drilled in it and it was covered in black electrical tape! When that one came down you knew it! Now with all the PC people coach would go to jail for assaulting the poor boy Hell, back then it was called character building. As I remember from the 7th grade on licks were given out. The soundtrack. Best ever. Might as well be back at White Rock Lake or Lake Ray Hubbard on a Friday night getting wasted. Head East was a nice touch. Every time I listen to that soundtrack I remember things I have not thought about in 25 years. The man that portrayed Pickfords dad was dead on. Accent, demeanor along with the big caddy and the tennis playing wife in the miniskirt and puffed up hair. Some of the reviewers mentioned they did not think it was too realistic showing/mixing a lot of sexual activity among the freshman girls. That is another point I must dispute. Maybe at their school in their town of 500 or their strict upbringing but at our junior high and high school the freshman and younger girls were pretty wild. I mean really wild! This is coming from someone who lost it at 12. So insinuating things about a 15 or 16 year old freshman is pretty tame. 15 and 16 year olds were the world travelers to us 13 or 14 year old guys. There is something about this movie that pulls me back over and over again. Its hard to describe. Im not sure what it is. Am I a Wooderson that enjoys reminiscing? Am I someone that prefers simpler times? Am I someone that is so sick of PC people that a movie like D&C is like a breath of fresh air? Was there something magical in the air back in 1976? The country was celebrating 200 years of freedom. Now within the last 30 years it seems that most of those freedoms have been slowly whittled away with and all that is left is a former shell of the old. Especially after 2001. The best scene? To me its a tossup between the opening Sweet Emotion GTO in the school parking lot and the Emporium scene with Hurricane playing in the background while (The Past) Wooderson, (The Present) Pink and (The Future) Mitch walk into the Emporium while the camera films every little nuance in slow motion. The cockiness of Woods, the mellow Pink and the innocence of Mitch. Put that scene on slow motion and study their faces and the reaction shots of their peers faces as they acknowledge their presence.Your own personal time machine if only for an hour and a half. Slip the DVD in, turn the lights down low, take a couple good strong hits and wash them down with a few Tallboys. Use your imagination and for the briefest of time you are back in 1976. I wish they made more movies like this instead of the sugar coated pablum coming out of Hollywood nowadays.Remember this?Howard Hughes died, Robin Trower Bridge of Sighs, Jeff Beck, Kawasaki Z1, Kawasaki 750 triple 2stroke, 45 cents a gallon gas, 104 octane gas, Frampton Comes Alive, Bad Company  Shooting Star, Elvin Bishop  Fooled Around and Fell In Love, Jimmy Carter, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, 1969 Dodge Charger 440, 2 Lane Blacktop, 3 finger lids, windowpane, Diamond Dogs, J.

"Intriguing, sensuous moviemaking of a high order.This lengthy (142mins) intriguing, complex movie follows the reflections of former novelist, Jem Gambardella (Toni Servillo), as he contemplates his past and current life, a life, it would appear, of lost opportunities both personal and professional. As a member of the wealthy elite of Roman society, he participates in their empty pastimes; parties fuelled with drink and drugs, bizarre art events and casual sexual encounters with beautiful but soulless women. Gambardella is both participant and observer, watching himself as much as his associates, mysterious animals trapped in the gilded cage that is Rome with all the stunning beauty of its architecture, fountains, sculptures, and paintings. We are shown a funeral where Gambradella acts out the etiquette he has just been describing to us; a dinner with a cardinal who seems more interested in food than faith; a saintly nun of extreme age mounting a stone staircase on her knees and crawling painfully onwards and upwards towards an image of Christ . . . Everywhere, life presents contradictions, material and spiritual, emotional pretence and genuine feeling, the Eternal City and its mortal inhabitants, . . .If all this sounds too heavy, everything is carried along by a welter of gorgeous images complemented by music that varies from the ethereal to hefty thumping dance beats. And the actors performances are never less than utterly convincing.At one of the parties as the massed participants enter into yet another congastyle dance, Gambardella remarks that we have the best trains in Rome because they dont go anywhere. Everything comes back to where it starts and ends where it began. So in the long final credits sequence we float languidly beneath the bridges of Rome, left to contemplate the setting in which we first encountered the genial but disillusioned Gambardella. This is an sumptuous, sensuous, fascinating movie which for me at least probably needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate. Dont miss it!(Viewed at Screen 1, The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK, 12 September 2013)",True
"The Tragedy of Baking a Cake If you have read any of the other reviews on this page, you have probably figured out The Hours is not the easy, mainstream film it was made out to be by the ads and the reviews.  Starring three of todays most popular leading actresses, winner of some Golden Globe awards, based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, and the recipient of numerous rave reviews; it would seem to be a film that would appeal to a lot of people.The Hours is not a regular Hollywood type of drama film. It has more in common with Ingmar Bergman films than with Terms of Endearment.  I think the thing that most people are having problems with is that the film does not explain what takes place or the significance of the context of what takes place.  Things happen and it is up to the viewer to decide what it means.  This is a controversial film and people will not only argue about whether or not the film is worthwhile, but they can also debate what exactly takes place during the film.  How a person interprets this film says more about the person than the film.The film follows a single day in the lives of three women in different time periods.  During this day, each of them makes a decision that will affect the rest of their life.I felt the film improved upon the book by bringing more clarity into the decisions of each character.  Also, some of the most memorable lines and scenes in the film did not exist in the book.While I would normally be the last person in the world to say anything positive about Phillip Glass, his score is evocative of the relentlessness of time.  This is accentuated by the ticking of the clock throughout the film.  The ethereal music also helps tie the three storylines together, to make it seem as if they are happening simultaneously.I think a lot of people were taken offguard by this film because they were expecting a more standard type of drama.  Also, the PG13 rating implies a lighter subject matter than is actually in the film.  Just as a warning: There is crying, suicide, and women kissing women.  Even though the violence and language is mild and there are no sex or nudity in the film, it should have probably been given an R rating because of the extreme emotion displayed in the film.  Emotionally unstable people should probably not see this film.As I said earlier, people will interpret this film differently since things are not spelled out for them.  For the record, I did not think all three women were suffering from clinical depression as suggested by some people. Virginias malaise would seem to fit the description of schizophrenia rather than clinical depression.  Clarissa was suffering from regret over a decision she made thirty years previous and the feeling that she will never experience that happiness again. That does not necessarily mean she is clinically depressed.  Laura is the depressed one and she makes a decision to handle that depression the way she thinks is best for her.  Also, I do not feel Virginia was either incestuous or a lesbian.  I think she was expressing her desperation through her disease and it came out in a socially unacceptable manner.There is no doubt in my mind that The Hours is a great film.  I only recommend it to people who are up to the challenge of thinking about the film long after they have left the theater and deciding about what it means. It is not a film for everybody but I felt it was worth the effort.",True
"great but often misunderstood film Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drivethru, nor is he interested in `plastics or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simons Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Bens is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.Nichols brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are firstrate.  Add Paul Simons haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",False
"Treading water in Wonderland Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Dont get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. Its a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computergenerated imagery onscreen. Sure its very efficient and welldesigned but like CGI in general, its far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overlyfamiliar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking Oh thats Stephen Fry, hey isnt that Alan Rickman, Im sure thats Christopher Lee and isnt that the bloke from Little Britain, etc. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counterproductive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voiceover actors.There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman – they say familiarity breeds contempt, well thats a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depps Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards, while Burtons visuals and Elfmans music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film, and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite, as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We dont know or have any interest in these characters, so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them, it means nothing. It also doesnt help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title characters state of mind – at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upperclass chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upperclass chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me its that I am done with this new and improved technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar; now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film, and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. Its all surfaceveneer, and really thats this movies ultimate problem, there is nothing of interest within the CGI/3D. A great shame, as the source material is undeniably compelling.I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then, subsequently, Alice do a truly cringeworthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I halfexpected Britains Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didnt happen. And that is, at least, one saving grace.",False
"Innocence Is Not An Absolute Like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER is a an extremely well made film , but like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS much of it is total invention . Reviewers on this page have already pointed out the numerous errors such as Guiseppe and Gerry Conlon never being imprisoned in the same jail or the  Guilford four  and  Mcguire seven  trials taking place in completely seperate court cases but no one seems to have pointed out the erroneous backgrounds this film paints of Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill. In their book THE PROVISIONAL IRA authors Patrick Bishop and Eamon Mallie state the facts quite clearly that Paul Hill was a member of the Belfast brigade of the provisonal IRA ( And Hill later did confess to being a member ) while Conlon had been a member of Na Fianna Eireann which is the youth section of the provisionals though Conlon was quickly kicked out ( Literally ) due to his heavy drinking and drug taking . They didn`t meet on the ferry as shown in the film but Conlon bumped into Hill in Southampton where Hill was staying . What was Hill doing in Southampton ? He was on the run from the IRA who wanted to question him about guns going missing and about the possibility of Hill being an informer , something that is always punishable in IRA ranks with death and prior torture . When Conlon returned to Belfast in December 1974 he did drunkenly mention to IRA acquaintances in pubs that he`d met Hill in England and in order to punish Hill for his suspected crimes against the organisation and to take the heat off their own cells active in Britain at the time it was the IRA themselves who deliberately leaked the false information to the intelligence services about Conlon and Hill being involved in the Guilford bombings , not as the film shows a jealous boyfriend . Hill was also later found guilty of the murder of a former soldier though is never shown in the film and it`s this playing hard and loose with the facts that almost threatens to destroy the film . It could have been worse though , there might have been the suggestion that the bombing could have been a mass suicide Well that`s the bad points out of the way . What`s IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER`s good points ? Well Jim Sheridan directs with a real kinetic force especially the early scene where Conlon is pursued by the Brits against a voodoo chile soundscape . Sheridan also gets the very best out of his cast . Emma Thompson is good as the crusading lawyer , Pete Postlethwaite is very good as Guiseppe Conlon , but the outstanding performance is by Daniel Day Lewis as Gerry Conlon . Has anyone noticed the bitter Irony of a film about injustice features one of the greatest injustices commited by the Oscar board voters where they gave that year`s best actor Oscar to a very average performance by Tom Hanks ? No wonder more and more people view the Oscars as a popularity contest . And despite my above criticisms about the facts  or lack of them  IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER can in no way be described as a pro IRA film in the way that THE DEVIL`S OWN  or SOME MOTHER`S SON are",False
"Im gonna break this thing wide open!One of Woody Allens winners from the 1990s (albeit on a minor scale) reunites him quite snugly with Diane Keaton. Allen and Keaton have such a livedin rapport (with plenty of jabs but no fatigue) that the sight of them together again in a comedy is an automatic uplift. They portray the Liptons, a regular N.Y.C. couple who suspect foul play from the elderly man in their building whose wife has suddenly died. Smooth, smartly assembled nuttiness with sensational support from Alan Alda as a playwright (with a crush on Keaton) and Anjelica Huston, putting off terrific comedic heat as a novelist. Wrapped up wonderfully with an homage to Orson Welles The Lady From Shanghai. Great fun! *** from ****",True
"A real film about real people This film tells the story of a man whose son is killed in an workplace accident. His wife insists on finding out the truth, and things descend into a downward spiral. Gods Pocket is a very sad film, as many tragic events happen in a deprived neighborhood. Characters are developed very well, making the film engaging. In the short time that the son appears in the film, he appears so obnoxious that viewers have little sympathy for him. The mother is stricken with grief, and makes poor decisions. Its a real fun about real people. Given its one of Philip Seymour Hoffmans last film, it deserves more attention.",False
"Class and Sorrow I have to say that I didnt expect much of Michael Clayton. But it has grown on me in such a way, reassuring me with its decided desolate aura, that I owe a review to those in a doubtful measure.Although it starts with some idle comings and goings, the first reaction we have is to alienate with Clayton. He is battered down, morally ambiguous, suffered. If one watches closely his eyes, one can discover within how a feeling of despair takes over. Clooney is a very happy, cheerful guy: you will appreciate his work, how he lets Clayton dominate Clooney.In here, the lawyer of the title must decide which side to take in an important lawsuit after his friend changes sides and endangers himself. Is he helping the good guys? How can he tell, deep Inside? The film carries the moral dilemmas, the strangled fight between choosing the good and the correct. Gilroy commanded a brilliant, harrowing script. But Clooney is the definite star, with his sadness, empathy. His sorrow is deeply moving. The Grey, moisturized environments, carefully veiled with a soft mist. Clooneys interior acting, arising within his foggy emotions. This film is not cheerful, its somehow depressing.

"Im retired. I invented dice. What do you do?A lucky mistake shifts outofluck criminal Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr) from the gritty streets to glossy showbiz in L.A, landing him a part in an upcoming film. Another mistake then shifts him from actor to private detective, and this is where Val Kilmer comes in and things start to go wrong, more wrong and unbelievably wrong until theyve snowballed into an enjoyable detective mess  all to impress failed actress Harmony (Next big thing: Michelle Monaghan).Shane Blacks directorial debut Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a comic film noir. Even in the dazzling opening credits using a montage of contrasts of red, black and white, it is evident that this is no runofthemill crime story, but a viciously entertaining ride from scene 01. What makes it so special is that it mixes equal doses of humour and crime like a $15,000,000 blender, pouring out a balanced end product and glazing it with a clever narrative coating by Robert Downey Jr. Black also sprinkles some rapidfire dialogue onto his product, which is facilitated by the comedic chemistry between Downey and Kilmer. Some of the lines, gags and images are truly laughoutloud worthy. Everything else is nice, but forgettable.Its only problem, as far as I can see it, is its paperthin plot. It does not seem believable; it is complex, dizzying and not nearly as involving as it would like to be. So back to formula on that one, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang would be a nearperfect comedythriller.7.5/10",False
"Desolation, Desperation, Vodka Leviathan takes a long, immersive look at the machinations of corrupted power in the lives of the powerless, who desperately struggle to stay the course, hoping against hope to win a losing battle.A man and his family face off against a politically backed fat cat who wishes to buy the piece of land upon which stands their house, willing to destroy their family nest to raise a modern building in its stead. The grandiose, solemn music of Philip Glass (Akhnaten; Act I Prelude) opens and ends the movie, flanking it like a sturdy front and back cover a fine book from a Russian masters pen. Other than that, the movie is rather stark, musically and otherwise. It is remarkable how effective silent scenes can be. With little music and less sound effects, the film has your undivided attention, reaching emotional heights towards the end. The lack of a musical backdrop further enhances the gritty realism that imbues all the 140 minutes. Relationships between the characters evolve and change significantly over the span of the movie, and though the patterns are somewhat familiar, interpersonal developments are portrayed with commendable subtlety and brilliance. There is a lot of intelligence to the storytelling; much can be understood without words. We embark on a chilling journey into the land and home of ordinary, simple folks, who are kicking and screaming for justice under the suffocating oppression of ruthless power, also blighted by their own frailty.Leviathan is an outstanding work of art that manages to drive home universally relevant points with sparkling clarity in its refreshingly honest way.

"Instant classic, but not for all audiences.I know its a couple years late, but I had to write a review for some of the few people that havent seen one of my favorite and refreshing Ive seen over the last few years. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantinos short, but distinguished list.Kill Bill involves a nameless woman (Uma Thurman) who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill (David Caradine.) Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital, without child, and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses (through this film and the sequel), you find out who she really, why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.The movie is really a combination of Tarantinos love for the 70s overdramatized Kung Fu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes, this movie is violent, but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up, failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said, it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside, I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of Kool Aid red blood shoot out of the body like a whales blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones, a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course, this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.There are various plot holes in the story, but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes, come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns, including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord, O Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui.) Once again, Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.I wouldnt really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase, revenge and Tarantinos continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If youre not a fan of Tarantinos films, you should pass on this one because it is doesnt stray to far from his other stuff. If you like his other works, this is a must see due to its originality and quality. And, if you just dont like Tarantino himself, and find him annoying like everybody else, I dont blame you but its still worth your while seeing.",True

"Excellent performances; soso story Elia Kazans On the Waterfront is frequently listed among the greatest of all American films. It concerns a longshoremans inner and outer struggles in exposing the corruption of union bosses.Unquestionably, the strength of the film is the acting. Brandos performance in particular is one for the ages. He won his first Oscar for this role and Eva Marie Saint also garnered an Oscar in her introductory film role. On top of that Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb & Rod Steiger all earned Best Supporting Actor nominations. These accolades give an idea of the level of talent on display here.Kazans direction is well done as he strives for a gritty, realistic look. Shooting on location was an important part of that. Leonard Bernsteins score, on the other hand, is often overbearing. Theres nothing wrong with the music itself, only the prominence of it.The main area in which I feel the film doesnt quite deliver is the story. The film does a fine job of exploring the characters but I find that the underlying storyline doesnt really work for me. The main premise is a good one but after the initial confrontation I began to lose interest. The selfconsciously inspiring ending doesnt help, either.All things considered, I give the film high marks for the excellent acting and direction which, unfortunately, are in service of a merely average story.",False
"A heartwarming and bittersweet little comedy Following all of the hype, it was impossible for me to not want to see Juno. Everyone has raved about it for months, and I waited patiently for it to be released somewhere nearby. And the wait definitely made it worthwhile.Juno chronicles the story of the titular sixteenyearold girl (played by Ellen Page), and the fallout of her accidental pregnancy. After deciding to not have an abortion, Juno decides that she will give the baby up for adoption to wouldbe parents Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) after finding an ad in the local classified section of the newspaper.It may not sound like a deep film, but right from moment one, the film draws you into Junos bizarre world of teenage angst and wonderment. It progresses through the stages of her pregnancy (and the seasons that pass), and through the various problems and issues that arise as a result of the pregnancy.This is aided almost exclusively by the commanding presence of Page. Her work here is simply astounding, and watching her mature as the film goes on is the stuff of movie magic. She plays Juno with a chip on her shoulder, and a keen sense of tongue in cheek. She is very in tune with the role, and even though it is not wholly original, she makes it her own and gives it a grand sense of earnestness (and pathos when needed). She plays it even better during the more hormonal aspects of the pregnancy, and she makes her undeniable mark on the moviegoing public as she does. After seeing her intense, calculating and downright terrifying work in Hard Candy, I knew that she would be a presence to be reckoned with. And in seeing Juno, I now know that she truly will continue to grow into a great actress.Supporting turns from just about everyone only further complement Pages terrific acting. Garner and Bateman, while not as well written as Page, do great as the wouldbe adoptive parents. While Bateman taps into his not so overthetop side (which he used to his great advantage in scenestealing roles in Smokin Aces and The Ex), and gives a great character performance, Garner does even better as the overdomineering wife. She gives the role a slightly creepy tinge in a few cases, but for the most part, delivers one of her best performances. While not as commanding as he was in Superbad, Michael Cera, as the father of Junos baby, gives his character a glossy sense of naivety as the film begins, but slowly falls into a grander sense of geeky goodness as the film goes on. His shy teenage chemistry with Page is astounding, and helps give the film its greatest moments of heartfelt drama. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney round out the cast, lending the film some of its deeply funny and dramatic moments as Junos parents, and relative newcomer Olivia Thirlby does very well as Junos best friend.But for how great the cast was, what I was really anticipating was the screenplay, by current sensation Diablo Cody. I was a little apprehensive at wanting to jump on the bandwagon of praising her, but the script is truly wonderful. While the start of the film feels a little forced with its witty and sarcastic banter, the film gradually progresses into a very fair balance of hilarity and drama. Its gradual depth does not go unnoticed, and as the film packs into its most dramatic scenes, it really becomes apparent that Cody has a great sense of how to write really well. First time screenwriters (or even screen writing hopefuls) can take notes in how well expressed the wording is here (and how obscure pop culture references can still be funny), and just how greatly written the film is. When dialogue comes so natural to some of these characters, it becomes very obvious that the writer knows what they are doing. If she keeps up like this, than I think she could truly be the prodigy that everyone is making her out to be (although Jennifers Body really does not sound like a step in the right direction).I think what only slows the film down is the near forced relationship between Page and Bateman that grows as the film goes on. I understand its importance to the film and understand why it is here, but I just think they play it a little too loosely and way too longish to make it feel as worthwhile as it needs to be. The two work off of each other well, yes (although not nearly as well as Page and Cera, or even Bateman and Garner), but the dialogue and scenes between them just sound like an afterthought, and do not seem in sync with the rest of the film. They have the humour, they have the references (maybe a few too many), but they just do not jive nearly as solidly as they should. Maybe a little less focus on these scenes, and more with the likes of Cera (who is not underused, but probably could have been used a bit more) or Simmons or Thrilby (who are not used nearly enough) could have helped make the movie even better than it already is.Juno is not perfect, but it is heartwarming and bittersweet all the same. I laughed and almost got choked up by how exquisitely written and how superbly acted the film was. Page is marvellous in the lead role, and Cody just might be on the right path to be true greatness. If only all small Indies could be nearly as memorable or nearly as astonishing as this one is. An obvious candidate for being one of the best (and funniest) films of the year.9/10.",True
"Low Key The movie itself is not really a big shouting message to tell people what to do. And even Aaron Paul, whose character may seem one dimensional does have things youll discover about him. There are more layers there and some need looking at them to see them. Nick Offerman plays it almost silently, but has one completely over the top scene (a scene with a followup joke that would fit in any other comedy too), that still does not derail the movie.But the main protagonist, our woman that we follow is what its all about. And she delivers in a way that is very heartbreaking to watch. And very real too. Everyday problems and things that get out of hand. You may cringe here and there, but the movie is still able to affect you very deeply.",True

But even though the bits towards the end which will have you bawling are what the film is remembered for, everything in this film is just...fantastic. parts are hilarious,parts are just sweet, and by the end of the film, you are genuinely caring for the characters.

I lent the video i have to some friends, and all of them loved it, and told me they cried.Seriously, this film will make you cry. big time.",True
"Most Likely Best Film of 2004Mike Leigh has done it again. I adore Secrets and Lies, my 2nd favorite film of all time and Leigh strikes gold again in the emotionally draining, brilliantly directed study of a 50s era abortionist in London. Imelda Staunton gives, yet another in Leighs film, outstandingly powerful and true performance as Vera Drake. She a innercity housewife and mother, who spends much of her free time trying to help out the poor ladies of 50s London who are unable to get legal abortions. Some may consider this a hottopic issue film, but its moreover an independent study of a woman and her life, and how her emotions play in her world. Every nuance of this film is perfectly crafted, from every performance, to the sets, and the cinematography. The emotions overflow steadily, especially after the traumatic dinner scene where the police arrive for Vera. The look of horror that Staunton displays and changes as she realizes what is happening is acting and direction at its best. Why is it American films arent able to capture this from its performers? I cant praise this film enough and truly believe that this will be my favorite film of the year. Its a shame this film got only a small release and audiences seemed unmoved by it. I dont understand it. Hopefully DVD will allow those who missed it to catch up with it and relish in its brilliance. It will be a rewarding experience for all to see. I am praying for Oscar noms all around, but especially for Staunton. It is clearly and without any doubt, the best female performance as of this date, this year.",False
"One of the best films of its kind I love movies like this. Theatrestyled motion pictures driven by dialog versus action. Get a few guys together in a room, watch them talk  I have a soft spot for this stuff. I have ever since I can remember. Some of my favorite films are characterdriven ones: The Hustler, The Big Kahuna, Midnight Run, Planes, Trains & Automobiles. At first glance this list seems skeptical  but basically all these films follow the same central theme: clever dialog, character interaction and evolution, and depth.Glengarry Glen Ross is one of the best of the genre. Scripted by David Mamet, the dialog never hits and weak patches  it is realistic, extremely fun to listen to, and the actors all deliver flawless performances.Al Pacino finally finds the perfect role to let himself vent (as he started to do in Scent of a Woman the same year, and won an Oscar for  he deserved it more for this). Pacino has some great oneliners and quips, but he never seems too broad to find believable.Jack Lemmon is similarly impressive, in what he called one of his favorite films of his entire career. Lemmon abandoned his comedic roots for this drama and it paid off  hes not only an excellent funnyman, but a great actor.Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, and Alec Baldwin fill out the rest of the cast and all do very well; especially Baldwin in a brief cameo. Ive never had much consideration for Baldwin as an actor, but his five minutes worth of screen time here reminded me that when hes good, he really IS good! Overall Glengarry Glen Ross is not only one of my favorite films of the genre but also a solid movie by any means. If you arent bored by movies in which people talk instead of running around defusing bombs, youll probably really get a kick out of this.",True
"Not Your Typical Patriot.Idealized biography of Hustler magazine mogul Larry Flynt (played superbly by Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson) which finally ends up focusing on his legal battles to publish his pornography via the free speech laws of this land. Along the way he marries a bisexual wild woman (Courtney Love) who shares his unconventional views on free love, priced pornography and drug abuse. The character also survives an assassins bullet, paralysis, imprisonment, endless court battles against the Reverend Jerry Falwell and even his own destructive nature. Edward Norton (a relative newcomer when this was released) shines as Harrelsons young attorney who tries to overlook and overcome his clients tirades. Director Milos Forman (Oscarnominated) does a good job creating a cinematic story about a man who is hard for most in mainstream society to understand or relate to. Flynt is humanized and so are those who cross his path throughout the picture. The movie is not as wild and crazed as one would think. Instead Forman uses welltimed comedy with drama to get the major points across effectively. Overall one of the better films of 1996. 4 stars out of 5.",False
"Revenge of the Teddy Bears How can any adult who enjoyed Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back possibly find anything entertaining, or even interesting, about this abysmal, unimaginative travesty?  A genuinely bad movie, truly awful in every possible way, Jedi features a screenplay aimed squarely at four year olds and absolutely terrible acting from an understandably embarrassed cast; in addition, the film offers us the shoddiest array of cheap, plasticlooking space aliens since Irwin Allens Lost In Space tv series. Yes, I realize it is this very cheapness that endears the movie to a legion of kitsch loving fans, but, as a direct followup to Empire, one of the most entertaining and inventive fantasy movies of the last twenty years, Jedi comes across as a particularly insulting spit in the face from George Lucas.  And those godawful teddy bears!  Is there anyone out there (over the age of four, that is) who doesnt cringe in horror at just the mere thought of those monstrously cute creatures?",False
"Woody Allens own Amarcord Radio Days (1987) written, directed, and narrated by Allen:What a beautiful, kind, gentle, ironic, warm, sentimental (in a very good way and yes, I am talking about Woody Allens movie, thats right) yet perfectly balanced delight. It is a series of sketches about young Joe (young Allen, of course, played by Seth Green  that was a surprise), an adolescent in Brooklyn, NY during 1930s1940s who was passionately in love with radio which was a king. The film is a tribute to the magical radio days and the myths and legends about radio personalities, the memory of a grown man who never forgot where he came from, the love letter to his always fighting and arguing (I mean, how many people argue over oceans?) but loving relatives and a very funny comedy (the way only Allens comedy can be). It is the film where pretty like a doll and painfully naive Sally (Mia Farrow) asks who Pearl Harbor is? Where gorgeous Diane Keaton sings and Diane Wiest, his beloved Aunt Bea never gives up hope of one true love. He never told us if she found it...I never forgot that New Years Eve when Aunt Bea awakened me to watch 1944 come in. Ive never forgotten any of those people or any of the voices we would hear on the radio. Though the truth is, with the passing of each New Years Eve, those voices do seem to grow dimmer and dimmer.The Radio days are gone but thanks to Allen, the voices of the times passed are still clear and sound and they always will be.9/10",False
"It will grow on you I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didnt seem to fit the mold of the film. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasnt sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so sidesplittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coens have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brothers film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homers Odyssey in here as well, but I wouldnt know that because I have never read Homers Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spooflike quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesnt know anything about it, I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again, as is usual for a Coen film, I wasnt sure why I was entertained or laughing, but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. Its too bad they didnt find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. I didnt really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I dont think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coens films. They have not been recycled and if they have I dont know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you dont get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!",False
"Indicative of Mickey Rourkes Career The Wrestler is a very good drama filled with originality. The film follows a fictional character named Randy Ram Robinson whose a has been wrestler. His prime far behind him and continues to wrestle hoping to get back in the lime light.The acting Mickey Rourke was quite good deserving his Oscar nomination. His feelings of loneliness and isolation is very heart felt and sad to watch. His search for some sort of love becomes far more important to him as wrestling now endangers his life. He attempts to reconcile with his daughter played by Evan Rachel Wood and takes a love interest in a stripper played very well by Marisa Tomei. Altogether it culminates into a very sad, open but yet satisfying ending. The authenticity of all the emotions could not be better displayed by any other actor than Mickey Rourke who like his character shares many experiences and hardships in order to get back to fame. It brings out an amazing amount of depth out of his character and simply pushes the film to that of the least a very good movie.The direction of Darren Aronofsky and writing of Robert Siegel combined for an amazingly heart felt sympathy portrayal of a man. The movie is left open yet simultaneously feels as if its all we need to know. That weve gotten what we need to see and can figure out things for ourselves. The abrasive and gritty look of the movie only adds to the emotions felt for the character. Usually I would not mention this at all but Bruce Springsteens song was a superb song for the movie as he always captures the scope of a movie and its complicity.Hopefully this film will set up Mickey Rourke for more films to make as he has certainly convinced me here that hes worthy of more lead roles. His comeback story is compelling in that he was literally a forgotten soul up until this was made. He reputation had dispersed so much that it took years of searching for distributors from Darren Aronofsky that would accept Mickey Rourke as the lead actor. Well it certainly payed off and it shouldnt of been made any other way.",True
"A Most Violent Year  Good but no cigar !!First of all let me just say, if IM Db allowed 0.5 votes, this would probably get a 6.5 from me. Where to begin with this one ? Well its shot well, the cast nail the parts, but from start to finish you are waiting for the film to come to life, and unfortunately it just never does.Some people will appreciate this film much more than others, but for me it was average at best. The main reason we all watch films and television, is to be entertained, and unfortunately with A Most Violent Year, it feels like we have been left wanting.You never really get to appreciate 1980s New York, a couple of panoramic skylines dont really cut it. With a bit more substance to the story, better visuals & some period music, this film could & should have been much better.Sausage1",False
"Who needs luck when you can break a guys arm in three places?Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer, its not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modernday revenge thriller. This presents an interesting experiment, actually. Considering that there arent really any surprises to be found in Taken, beyond those we were offered in the prerelease snippet, are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding yes. Taken may be a simple film, but its not simplistic, and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in, the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting, even if we know exactly where its going.By setting the chase within the ultrasleazy world of human trafficking, which we secretly hope is just a media creation, but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality, the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that isnt present in most revenge films. Liam Neesons daughter isnt Dead, shes Taken, so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly whats going to happen here.The selling point here is how deftly Liam Neeson hacks his way through a bevy of Albanian baddies. Neeson is untested as an action star, but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here, were left hoping that hes got a franchise in him.The film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted Bourne films (although, like every action film made since Bourne appeared on the screen, the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to Matt Damons antics), but the gritty and realistic path Neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic trailer.You dont have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with Liams plight here, and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions. Sometimes morally complex, ambiguous studies of mans desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining. Taken doesnt really care if you like Liam Neeson or wonder if hes doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands; the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beatdowns all over Paris.This film doesnt want you to think. Like Neesons character quickly realizes, thinking is often not a luxury present in dire circumstances like these. Action is what counts, and for those who miss the era of the lean, mean 85minute skullcrack fest, Taken will reconjure the giddy thrills of watching Dudikoff, Seagal, and Van Damme chomp through a slew of B Movie terrorists. Having an Oscarcaliber actor delivering the judo chops only sweetens the pot.Forget about Oscars, plot points, or coherence. This dudes daughter has been kidnapped, and hes a former government agent trained to make bad guys lives a living hell. Do you want to see him find his daughter and take down the scum who took her? Of course you do. Even reading this review is overanalyzing it.",False
"perfect allen Very funny comedy has one of Woodys all time best casts. Dianne Wiest is the best; glowing, neurotic, irritating and vulnerable, within minutes. Michael Caine is the most touching, Mia Farrow, as always, close to heartbreaking. I think its her voice that does it. Nice scenes with her and her reallife mother, Maureen O Sullivan.Like Manhattan, this picture looks beautiful; NY in all its many breath taking colors. The relationships of everyone on the screen are perfectly woven, and Woody has the best sight gag of the film when he takes a bible and a crucifix out of a paper bag (to find religion), and follows them up with some Wonder Bread and mayonaisse. Hilarious!Deserving of its writing and supporting actor Oscars, its too bad everyone in the movie couldnt have won. Theyre all believable and enjoyable to watch. My favorite: Max Von Sydow as the very cynical, older Frederick. He should have had more moments. Imagine him at one of the Thanksgiving dinners...",True
"A Beautiful Tale of Life. And Death.Rabbit Hole is a tragic tale that wont sadden viewers. That is simply not the purpose despite what the plot and trailer may show. Rabbit Hole is a story of how two previously happy couple cope with the loss of their fouryearold son. The what/who/where/why/how is what makes Rabbit Hole one of 2010s finest films.Right off the bat you will notice what surrounds this couple; a world filled with joy and life at the worst moment in their lives. This feeling does not lend itself to that Oscarfeeling feel it may have wanted but it certainly works. These actors give highly realistic performances that fit perfectly with this demanding plot. Nicole Kidman steals the show with her best performance (and movie) since Eyes Wide Shut. Aaron Eckhart also gives a terrific performance as the grieving husband and father and, after Love Happens, shows that he is back to serious acting as he was in The Dark Knight.The best aspect of Rabbit Hole is how you begin by knowing very little about these characters but end up knowing them as if they were your own neighbors. You progressively learn what happened to their son and other details within their past that fit perfectly together without feeling as they are giving the audience answers. The dialogue also lends itself to this method and, surprisingly, never feels directed to the audience.What I found unique is how with such a depressing feel to the film, it never actually makes the viewer sad, but interested. It is a film that will make you laugh more than cry and I found that impressive. It isnt your normal tearjerker; you are watching this couple live their lives and deal with this death in an interesting way. Rabbit Hole never has a dull moment; my eyes were glued to the screen from the start.Rabbit Hole is simply one of the finest films of 2010. Its execution is sometimes brilliant and the feeling of selfawareness and thought it lends to the viewer is unlike anything you may have ever seen. Its not your runofthemill Oscar contender. Rabbit Hole is a beautiful tale of life. And death.",False
"Powerful The movie is a timely piece of filmmaking in this era of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. I have to admit my prejudice for the film because of my past as one of the prisoners depicted in the film. Long Kesh  or the Maze as the British infamously renamed it  was the Abu Ghraib of its day. One stark difference though: unlike Abu Ghraib, no one has ever been charged with the horror and relentless torture inflicted upon naked, defenceless prisoners in Long Kesh. The film is uncompromising in its examination of the events leading up to and beyond the Hunger Strike. Michael Fassbender is frighteningly real. But I will leave it up to the words of Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian to sum it up: Hunger is raw, powerful filmmaking and an urgent reminder of this uniquely ugly, tragic and dysfunctional period in British and Irish history",False
"Stephen Kings best adapted movie Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly wont be the last. The standing on the IM Db is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and Im sure it could be number 1. So Ill just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I dont know if there will again.Im not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",True

"Waste of a good cast! 3/10Review: I found it really hard to get into this film because the storyline was weak and extremely unrealistic. The movie is based around a couple of guys who kidnap a rich mans wife in order to get a million dollars for her release. Not the most unique idea for a film! Anyway, I was expecting it to be witty, judging by the cast, but it was more silly than amusing. Mos Def and John Hawkes come up with the dumbest of plans, which was just not that well thought through. When there plan starts to go downhill, there terrible criminal minds come up with another sketchy plan to get themselves out of the mess they made. The storyline goes from one extreme to another and it doesnt help that they have a Nazi loving criminal to help them, who also has personal issues. Basically, the movie wasnt funny or interesting but I did stick with the film, just to see what these dumb criminals were going to do next. Average! Round Up: Judging by the unsuccessful box office takings, Im not alone with thinking that this film was a total waste of a good cast. Its not often that Jennifer Aniston makes Straight To DVD movies, but after watching this film, its not surprising that it flopped. All of the actors try and make the most out of a terrible storyline, but there performances isnt enough to save the film. On the plus side, I did like the ending when characters decide to flip the script and kidnap someone else but it doesnt really go anywhere. I didnt get how someone could go missing for a week without anyone suspecting anything and there was some other sketchy moments that I dont want to mention because I dont want to spoil the film for people who havent watched it. At the end of the day, it could have been much better if the storyline was thought through properly and if the actual plan made any sense.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $1.5million I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/crime movies about a couple of down and outs, who plan to kidnap a rich mans wife for a million dollar ransom. 3/10",False

A jumble of weird political statements and a masterclass in overacting the only thing going for this film is the fact its a little over an hour in run time. With shallow characters who are easy to hate and are mostly uninteresting with the exception of Murphys Tom this film is sadly not what it couldve been. The setting is great as is the cinematography and style plus theres some great uses of music but sadly the story is simple (which can be fine) but poorly executed, not what it couldve been",False
"Wonderful fable plenty  of  amazing fantasy,  lively comedy and  sad tragedy This is a poignant and moving fable about a sacrifice to save the sweethearts life.

Shes injured and Attilio is determined to save his lover from dangers around them and encounter medical care. His effort sometimes is pure fantasy , though with ruse he pull off more impetus to keep his wounded lover and accomplishes feats no man could realistically execute.This is a story about love, war and sacrifice, well starred and directed by Roberto Benigni who develops a fireline between comedy and tragedy. Inventive gags and wacky humor are splendidly proceeded. Benigni tirelessly maintains the humorous ingenuity, even as the horror war escalate. Actor and director Benigni shapes simultaneously haunting and hilarious comedy out of the tragedy of Irak. The film displays an emotive musical score by Nicola Piovani, Oscar winner by Life is beautiful. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Fabio Cianchetti. The motion picture is marvellously directed by Benigni.

"Woody Allen hits the nail on the head, yet again Match Point was the movie that converted me into a Woody Allenfan. I had literally hated the mans work, but suddenly I found that these movies really spoke to me more than before. I guess you just have to grow older and get a little life experience before you can appreciate Woody Allens fabulous writing. Lately, Ive been catching up on his filmography and was blown away by his immense power of observation. Out of all his classic movies that Ive seen in the past couple of days Husbands And Wives made the biggest impression so far. This movie is fearless, honest and true. Allen really hits the nail on the head with this one.Unlike movies like Crimes And Misdemeanors or the aforementioned Match Point (which are both great) Husbands And Wives isnt laden with symbolism and there are no highly philosophical thoughts to be found. The movie is merely depicting the universal truth that its tough to remain honest and passionate in a marriage. Masterfully Allen shows his struggling characters in all their weaknesses without ever making them unlikeable. These characters falter between loyalty, fear of loneliness and an undeniable desire for passion. Everybody whos ever been in a longtime relationship will be able to identify with these problems, but only the brave ones will be able to admit that to their partner.Thats the beauty of this movie. Allen says what everybody else is either too afraid or too hypocritical or simply unable to. Husbands And Wives shows what the fewest people understand: the egoistical side of love, the way we cling to relationships because were afraid of being alone, but also the simple fact that sometimes we need to lose something to understand how much we need it. Even when theres still love we can reach a point where we lie and betray the other person, just because sometimes people are confused about their lives and their feelings.Nobody has voiced our confusion about love and death as accurately as Woody Allen and hes rarely done it better than here. Husbands And Wives is recommendable for everyone, especially couples, but be prepared that watching this might lead to uncomfortable discussions. The truth is hardly ever convenient.",True
"What a terrific acting movie I consider myself lucky that I got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors. Kramer vs. Kramer was great to me because I think I could relate to it.Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Even though I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst. Through this movie, actually, I think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they had as just much pain as my sister and I had.Back to the movie, this was a good one. Yes, its dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend this for a lot of people, because I think most can relate in some way. There are funny, sad, happy, and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors. Its a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5.9/10",True
"Staggeringly Beautiful...I cant describe the power of this film, and I cant stop thinking about it either. Theres a negative review on here that says to go see MICHAEL CLAYTON instead and not to waste your time. Well, if a movie about plot, overly drawn characters and artifice, all shot by the book, is what youre looking for, then yes... this probably isnt the movie for you.But if you like people more than stories. If you want to see filmmaking at its most graceful and organic and inventive, if you want a musical score that will turn a sidelong glance into an operatic overture, then this IS the movie for you. It is a baroque masterwork. A cathedral of a film. Cold as stone but inspiring the soul. Tilda Swinton is a goddess. She says so little, but communicates so much. Theres an entire ocean of emotion inside or her, spilling out of her eyes. I cried twice at this film. Once because of the subject matter and then again at the delicacy of the filmmaking. Dont let people with conservative tastes and conventional ideas of film and story tell you not to go see this movie. They are robbing you of experiencing pure emotive cinema.",True
"The secrecy made everything better! (NO SPOILERS)First of all, if you want to watch 10 Cloverfield Lane, make sure to avoid any kind of spoilers on the internet. I will try to write this review without spoilers, even if its a bit difficult considering the movie I just witnessed.10 Cloverfield Lane is an amazing mystery/suspense movie that serves as a sequel to the 2008 hit Cloverfield. I have to say, its hard to tell if the greatness of this movie is going to hold up in 10 years because of how everything surrounding the movie made it better, but I really really liked it.Me and my friend tried to avoid the spoilers on the internet and read as less as possible on the movie before we went to see it. Fortunately, the brilliant marketing campaign did not reveal anything about the story, and the fact that it was a sequel to Cloverfield is going to make you constantly guess. Is it a traditional horror/suspense movie? Is it a monster movie? Where are the monsters? WHAT IS GOING? (Pretty much what I kept asking myself all along the movie)John Goodman was incredible, definitely the standout of this movie. The soundtrack was great, some jukebox oldies and a thrilling score.The movie starts with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) driving off from her marriage and taking the road to leave her husband. This is made with a perfect montage, and theres no dialogue for the first 45 minutes of the movie. Then, things take a turn and we are transported to the bunker you saw in the trailers.I will say it again, go watch this film, and dont read anything about it on the internet. I cant recall the last time a movie kept me guessing like this one. If you tend to get bored and tired by the usual clichés in movies, buy your ticket to 10 Cloverfield Lane and enjoy your time at the movies.Clever marketing, brilliant story, very good direction, great performance by the cast, its hard to complain about this film!9/10",False
"Superb realization of the Broadway musical This was a simply stupendous movie. The visuals and costumes were stunning, the new realization of the musical score excellent. Madonna deserves more credit than she has gotten for this. Although her voice is perhaps a bit thin for the role, she really stretched herself for this, and did a fine job. Banderas was simply fantastic. Most of the naysayers (and there are many), clearly dont care for Weber, or for musicals in general. Of course it isnt deep, its a musical! The question is how well was the original play transformed to the screen, and I would be hard pressed to imagine anything more successful than this.",True
"20th Century Women is too personal to appeal to the masses and too insignificant to deserve two hours of your time.Mike Mills is a music video producer, graphic designer and writer/director of documentaries and feature films. He has made music videos for Yoko Ono, Moby and Air. He has done album art for the Beastie Boys, Sonic Youth and Ol Dirty Bastard. He also makes posters and fabrics as part of a series of works called Humans by Mike Mills. Why this biographical sketch of Mike Mills? Well, it might help you understand his films. Two of the first three features that he wrote and directed (not counting 2005s Thumbsucker) are semiautobiographical. His 2010 film, Beginners is about his father who came out as gay late in life (a role which won Christopher Plummer an Oscar). Mills 2016 feature, 20th Century Women (R, 1:59), is about his mother, a role that earned Annette Benning some awards season love.In 1979 Santa Barbara, Dorothea (Bening) only has one child and shes divorced from the boys father, but she still has a house full of people. Besides her 15yearold son, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), theres the boarder she took in, a 20something photographer and cancer survivor named Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and William (Billy Crudup), the middleaged handyman who is gradually renovating Dorotheas 75yearold house. Then, last but not least, theres 17yearold Julie (Elle Fanning), who doesnt technically live in the house but might as well, as she often climbs in through Jamies bedroom window to talk and sleep with him, as part of a very close but platonic friendship. Dorothea also frequently invites nearstrangers over for dinner, such as someone she meets at a music club or local firemen who help her out of a jam.As a mother, 55yearold Dorothea is loving and devoted, but also insecure and kind of clueless. Shes deeply concerned about raising her son to be a good man in the absence of a regular male influence. (She rarely dates and William and Jamie dont really connect.) Dorotheas solution is to ask Abbie and Julie to help her raise her son. She wants Julie to look out for Jamie and Abbie to share her life with him. Both are a bit confused by the request, but agree to do what they can. Abbie lends Jamie some feminist books from a college class she took, Julie teaches Jamie to smoke like a man, and neither of them is shy about talking with Jamie about sex. Jamie keeps insisting that hes fine, but his world does begin to expand, just as his mother also comes out of her comfort zone to experience more of the modern age.20th Century Women is boring and basically pointless. The film is billed by Mills as a love letter to the women who raised him. (Besides Benings portrayal of Mills mother, Gerwigs character is loosely based on Mills sister.) Most of us were raised by a mother and/or had strong, loving female influences in our lives to whom we owe a great deal, but few of us would expect people to sit for two hours learning about the women who nurtured us. Its not that Dorothea is uninteresting as a character, but she doesnt come off as any more interesting than my own mother, for example. Whats more, there doesnt seem like theres much to learn from Dorotheas permissive and scattershot parenting style and, excepting the epilogue voiceovers at the end of the film, none of the characters really grow much – or have the potential to inspire us very much. The acting is excellent (especially Bening), but that does little to entertain when its in the service of an otherwise unimpressive film. C",False
"To The Extreme I just got back from an advanced screening of Wanted. I have to admit not being a fan of the Director, Tim Bekmambetov. Somewhat disappointed in his Russian Films Nightwatch and Daywatch. However, in his American directorial he delivers!! An abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond xtreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. James Mc Avoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of antianxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelie Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination. Believe me when I say what the Matrix introduced, Wanted has mastered. The director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of Wesley like I have never seen before, wait I take that back, seen it in Night Watch. I definitely recommend this deliberately humorous, action packed, violent, profane, totheextreme film to be seen on the big screen  check this one out!!",False
"Faith & Persistence Based on a true story, Vinny Pazienza overcomes a terrible car accident to return to the sport he truly loves, Boxing. I was a bit hesitant to see this movie because of all the previous movies about fighters. However the director quickly immerses you into Vinnys world and you are immediately hooked. What I liked most about the movie was how all the characters were so believable. The close family relationship, the mothers ritual when all the relatives are glued to the tube, the family dinners, ornaments etc. Everyone has a lot of soul and individuality. Vinnys determination is all important, but he has the affection and love from friends and family. Most of all he has his coach, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. A man who is fighting is own demons of being a has been, wanting a winner, but also knowing that a coach must do what is best for those under his charge, regardless of what is best for him or others.",False
"The Most Quotable Film of All Time Those Coen brothers have an ear for language. You feel it in the singsongy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machinegun dialogue of Millers Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.Channeling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (The Dude to his friends) into a strange triplecrossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinatedupon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dudes bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. Hed much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).As with so much of the Coens output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny headtrip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?This is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now, if you havent already.",True
"A stellar space film that is literally about space and vertigo and survivalfiction, but not science fiction Gravity (2013)A ridiculously visual movie. The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.The idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuarons previous major film, Children without Men. And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a coconspirator in his films. Thats a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of effects if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. Its an achievement.Sandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her colead George Clooney. And shes pretty amazing. You might think she doesnt get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when shes talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.Once you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of neardeath mishaps.The answer is no. And thats a strength. Its definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (theres a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid Grey. No distractions here.Except the visuals. Even in 2D this must be something to marvel at. The 3D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but its also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullocks tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.The photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh outloud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. The best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullocks. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and its both gorgeous and taut with terror. There have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various eventsthe different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles awaybut you have to just let all that go. It doesnt really matter. Its not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. Its hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isnt crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesnt work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.a postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film Aningaaq which is recently posted all over.

"Magnificent. The Coen Brothers take a detour.Let me say up front that most fans of the Coen brothers early films might be disappointed if theyre expecting Fargo, The Big Lebowski or even O Brother. Unlike those movies, here we dont have a lot of plot, comedy or action. The message of the film is very challenging, and it requires a lot of thought to figure out what theyre saying.Id say this movie is for fans of the recent American films Synecdoche NY, Doubt, and the recent Japanese films Departures, Yureru and of course the classics by Kurosawa like Rashomon. What Im saying is that this is a film that tackles philosophical questions of perception, faith, and in particular, uncertainty.If youve had some physics, youre in for a real treat because much of the theme centers around Schrödingers Uncertainty Principle, briefly touched upon in the Coens excellent 2001 film The Man Who Wasnt There. Here they give us a more powerful dose. If youve never heard of this principle, dont worry, you can look it up on Wikipedia or you can accept my synopsis of it, which Ill warn you might be flawed because I aint no physicist:The Uncertainty Principle (or Schrödingers Cat) proves mathematically that certain events are unknowable. It proposes the idea of a cat that might be alive or dead, but we cannot know without looking inside the cage. At the same time, the minute we look inside the cage, the cat will be killed by a toxic gas. The bottom line: we cant know the answer. Ever.From there, the movie explores how different people react when confronted with the unknown. Some form prejudices. Some fall back on faith. Some become faith LESS. And some just dont care.This is a beautifully crafted film that shows us the nature of human beings in that respect. No, theres not really a story. But it does even better than that: it challenges our minds to see elements of our own lives within the life of this ordinary schmuck. I am truly amazed at the Coens accomplishment, and I hope they continue in this direction in the future, though Im sure it may hurt their mainstream appeal.If you see this film & like it, I think youll really enjoy the other films Ive listed as well as the Hungarian masterpiece Werckmeister Harmonies, anything by Wim Wenders (The End of Violence touches on the same Uncertainty Principle) and Orson Welles The Trial.",True
"Young Cast Give Amazing Performances, Great Soundtrack, Emotionally Moving I absolutely loved this film  specifically the acting, music and even at times the cinematography. Steven Chbosky captured the spirit of the book and the characters magnificently  Ezra and Logan give exceptional performances that deserve major credit. Emma gives a strong performance as Sam  you can tell that she really understands the character, however she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry  shes in Bling Ring next year and will have improved by then, she does a great job of finding her ground and portraying a troubled yet lovable and wonderful teen, at times her actions speak much louder than her words. Logan is phenomenal at every aspect of Charlie  awkward, unsure, emotional, honest  he gives an amazing performance. Ezra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a moments notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances from Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is truly the heart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of humour, emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellent soundtrack to back it up.",True
"An atmospheric, blackly comic look at celebrity obsession Sofia Coppola is one of the most interesting and divisive filmmakers working today. It seems that with every new film she releases theres always a wide array of responses, both positive and negative. And thats very true with her new film, The Bling Ring. Some love it, and some loathe it. I personally enjoyed it very much, and the more I think about it, the more I like it and would maybe even see it again. Its an interesting and atmospheric look at American celebrity and media culture that bleakly shows how we can think being rich and famous can make us happy. The film is based on a Vanity Fair article about how in 2008, a group of Californian teenagers (4 girls & 1 boy) stole millionsofdollars worth of clothing and jewelry and possessions from celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom, Megan Fox, and others. Its a strangerthan fiction kind of story that could lend itself to exploitation, satire, or even heavyhanded moralizing, but Coppola distances herself from the lurid material and simply displays it as a set of facts. Its a cold, deadpan film, but theres several fascinating moments of insight and darkly funny commentary that make it interesting. Its been compared to Harmony Korines similar film Spring Breakers, which also features several young girls trying to experience the medias view of what a fun Spring Break is. Whereas that film is knowingly repetitive in its dialogue and images and very violent and exploitative to get its point across, Coppola goes for a more restrained and almost documentary type of style. In fact, theres several instances where the main action is interrupted and we see scenes of the characters being interviewed after the events or TM Zlike celebrity news stories. The Bling Ring is benefited by its central young actors who give strong, naturalistic performances that feel so livein that they give an improvisational feel. The leaders of the Bling Ring are Marc (Israel Broussard) and Rebecca (Katie Chang). Marc is the quiet, insecure gay kid who soon is taken under the wing of Rebecca, whos troubled yet confident and coldasice. Broussard is charming and subtly sympathetic and Chang is hyperperceptive, smart, and cold but not without a conscience. Theres Chloe (Claire Julien), the loud and outgoing one in the group. Then theres sisters Sam (Taissa Farmiga) and Nicki (Emma Watson). Its interesting seeing Watson in a supporting role since shes arguably the most famous out of the central gang, but it pays off because of Nickis largerthanlife, selfabsorbed Valley Girl personality. Watson is the scenestealer of the film with her smart and satirical performance that never goes overthetop and always feels real, which makes the character that much more misguided and tragic. Its early to say something like this, but its a performance that deserves some Best Supporting Actress recognition. Also very good and inspired here is the always funny Leslie Mann, who plays the flighty mom of Sam and Nicki and teaches them the ever so spiritual teachings of The Secret. Theres a scene near the end of the film between Watson and Mann that is just pure, dark comedy gold. The plot mostly consists of the gang clubbing, breaking into houses, driving around, and trying on clothes. It sounds repetitive, and well, technically it is. But Coppola distinguishes each breakin with its own tone and style and you can very subtly see how the characters change as they become more and more comfortable with invading the houses. For example, the breakin of Audrina Patridges house is all done in one, long take from outside, across the street as Marc and Rebecca rummage through all her things and run from roomtoroom and eventually leave. Another breakin finds Sam cluelessly waving around Megan Foxs pistol without a care in the world. And one of the films most telling and haunting shots comes when the gang is inside Lindsay Lohans house and Rebecca stares at the mirror and smiles so genuinely that it almost seems like thats the happiest shes ever been. Its a truly disturbing and haunting moment and the film is full of subtle images that let you into the characters psyche and ego. But the glue that holds the film together is the dynamic between Marc and Rebecca. Theres several poignant and moving moments between the two characters that cut through the film like a knife and let you into the ultimately empty and sad feelings the two characters have. Their scenes and dialogue are so sharply drawn that it reminds you just how gifted of a writer Coppola is as well. So this movie just worked for me. Its not a film thats trying to dig deep into its subject, and its not even really interested in telling you all of the details about this group of young robbers. Its ultimately this odd, offkilter tone poem thats beautiful to look at and at times surprisingly poignant and hilarious. (And lastly Id like to mention the great and legendary work of cinematographer Harris Savides, who, during shooting this film, passed away from brain cancer. The film is dedicated to him.)",False
"River Phoenix at his best.The best reason to watch this film is of course the performance by River Phoenix, which now that hes dead, we will never know if he could have topped this.  He was one of the youngest actors ever nominated for an Oscar. Another reason to watch the film is Christine Lahti from Chicago Hope who gives her best screen performance here. She won the Los Angeles Film Critics award for Best Actress of 1988 and received a Golden Globe nomination but unfortunately she must have just missed when they announced who the five finalists were for the Oscar. She has two scenes in this film where she just tore my heart out, including one with Steven Hill from Law And Order who plays her father. The movie did get an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay and made many top ten lists, including Roger Eberts. Although it wasnt a box office hit, I believe it will be remembered as one of Director Sidney Lumets best films and certainly the best one to watch if you want to remember why the talented actor River Phoenixs death was so tragic.",True
"A very artsy film This film tells the life of an American homosexual poet named Hart, who died of suicide by jumping off a sailing army ship.The Broken Tower is shot in black and white. It is a tell tale sign that it is a very artsy movie that has no commercial elements at all. I tried very hard to enjoy it, trying to appreciate the slowness of the pace, and trying to enjoy the beauty of the literature reading. However, there is really very little plot in the film, and the story is told in a very scattered manner. For every 30 seconds of plot, there are five minutes of self indulgent filler scenes. I got quite tired of watching James Franco walking around or sitting around. We also see a lot of Harts sexual liaisons, ranging from walking up the stairs with another man, to apparently nonsimulated oral sex.After watching the whole film, I did not gain an insight into Harts life, but rather it felt more like a project for James Franco to expose the exploration his sexuality.",False
"Mighty Aphrodite Hot on the highheels of Showgirls comes Woody Allens latest film, Mighty Aphrodite, named after the Greek goddess of love, another American film trying to interrogate the questionable mentality and dubious spirituality of the skin trade. A lot will probably be made of the fact that, not satisfied with merely pointing out classical references in his text, Allen decided to have a whole Greek Chorus (consisting of F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis, David Ogden Stiers and Jack Warden) filmed in an ancient outdoor amphitheater in Taormina, Italy (wearing masks, no less, in a nod to classical authenticity) and genuflect on the alter of genuine myth to underscore the tragic and comedic parts of his film. It doesnt matter how well versed you are in the Greeks, youll be able to enjoy what Allen has done with his approach, which is a very refreshing idea for film (bringing it all back home) and also a great surreal scaffold for the situation he presents. Purists be warned. Allen (Now 60 years old, but trying to play his role like hes not a day over 40) and Helena Bonham Carter (29 years old) are happily married when one day Bonham Carters biological clock goes off and she wants to have a baby immediately. Allen hesitates so much at the thought of pregnancy that Bonham Carter, who really cant wait, says, fine, lets adopt, then, which of course hits the raw nerve of Allens masculinity as he defends his genes against the idea of having someone elses child join their family.Allens character in this film is a sportswriter, adding another tough layer to his neverending quiche of a meditation/angstridden search for definitive masculinity. Every scene where Allen suffers some sort of genderrelated torment is set in a male arena: When hes fighting on the phone with Bonham Carter about the decision to adopt, the backdrop is a boxing club with every ring filled with sparring partners. Another scene where he contemplates his situation shows him pacing back and forth on the sidelines watching the New York Giants scrimmage in the Meadowlands.The couple finally decide to adopt a boy, and in one scene in particular I realized just how much Allen is stuck in a zeitgeist rut. In their uptown apartment Allen and Bonham Carter bandy names back and forth for the new little tike as Allen, forever the cultural namedropper, comes up with the monikers of all of his heroes: Django, Groucho, Thelonius. Bonham Carter is oblivious to his suggestions as she coddles the baby and suddenly you realize that Allen should have made this film years ago, because the conversation sounds like something that was written for what would have been the sequel to Annie Hall. Now that hes twenty years removed from the carefree days of dynamic dialogue with Diane Keaton and the spark she brought as Allens main female foil, Bonham Carter seems unsure of herself, treating Allen as obligatorily as a father or uncle rather than her husband. Enter the plot.Bonham Carter is being chased by Peter Weller (48 years old), a seductively sleazy art gallery owner, which sends Allens midlife crisis into an absolute tailspin as he begins wondering if hes really happy with his wife, and as hes looking at his newly adopted son he wonders aloud what the mother of his adopted child is like. Enter Cassandra and...you get the picture.One of the things I realized while watching Mighty Aphrodite is that Allen has spent a good portion of his career in film flagellating himself for not being the American Ingmar Bergman, when all the time he should have been luxuriating in the fact that hes the American Federico Fellini: He has an uncanny sense for seeking out ripe minor actors, ready to be picked, and then letting them find the aspect of the character theyre playing that makes them Characters rather than just parts played by actors. Even though I feel as if Bonham Carter is not given nearly enough room to fully flesh out her character (which is a shame for an actress of her caliber), the film is really about Linda, the real mother of Allen and Bonham Carters adopted child, who turns out to be a ditzy porn star overflowing with spunk and zeal.Linda, played by Mira Sorvino (Quiz Show, Barcelona), Paul Sorvinos daughter, steals the film. Allen has tempted fate and defied the Greek Chorus warnings by seeking out Linda, but since shes in the skin trade he arranges to meet her at her apartment in the guise of being merely a john. When Allens reticence at whambamthankyoumaam sex gets the better of him, he finally shows the age and mindset that he really is and turns into a grandfather before your very eyes.But, Linda is a ditz first and a hooker second in that she understands her victimization but also begins to realize that her situation is only as hopeless as her innate tenacity is boundless. In the most delicate scene in the film, and maybe the most poignant scene Ive seen all year, Sorvino is in her bathtubsized kitchen trying to defend her life to Allen, and as she keeps talking she realizes her own complicity until she finally mentions that she even had a baby once that she gave up for adoption. Allen gives her this scene by not entering the frame for what seems like a full minute. The direction in this scene alone, in Lindas chessily decorated flat complete with clocks of pigs in heat, shows just how gifted Allen is at being able to take an obscure actress, give her a twodimensional role and have her find the heart and soul of the film on her own.Leave it to Woody Allen to deliver a film that is fascinating on many levels and is as beautifully structured as anything youre likely to see all year. I dont believe its Best Picture material, but it does show a very strong return to form for Allen, no matter how unsure he is of reentering the war between the sexes.",False
"Enthusiastically quirky One could technically label Bernie a docudrama, as it is definitely more than meets the eye in terms of bringing facts to the table. The film is intercut with segments featuring the townspeople of Carthage, Texas discussing their relationship with the real Bernie Tiede and how his cheery eccentricities rubbed off on the town. Some of them are clearly actors, one of them being Matthew Mc Conaugheys mother, but many are authentic folk off the street. Linklater very early on breeds variety into a film with so many unique and cute subtleties that after a while, you contemplate what you may have missed. Enthusiastically Tiede is an assistant funeral director in Carthage, and cant be more proud of what he does. Hes the man who fixes up the dead to make them look sometimes better than they did alive. Bernie is notorious for connecting deeply with his customers who have come to him after the death of a loved one, and even manages to stay in contact with many of them long after the funeral, dropping by and even bringing them flowers occasionally. Hes a genial, kind soul and effortlessly brightens everyones day. Almost like that guy on the street, at the office, on the bus, or in the neighborhood you dont know personally, dont know their history, or quite possibly even know their name, but you make the humane nuance to wave or say hello to them frequently. Tiede is an ode to that person in your life.Bernie becomes friends with Marjorie Nugent (Mac Laine), a wealthy old widow, who is meanspirited and, after occupying a certain disdain for him, gives into his cheeriness and they begin hanging out with each other. It isnt long before Bernie grows weary of Mrs. Nugents browbeating comments and shoots her four times in the back. Devastated at what he has done out of pure anger, he manages to conceal the body for months before the district attorney Danny Buck (played extremely well by Mc Conaughey, whose character somewhat resembles Woody Harrelsons coldblooded cop from Rampart), a cowboyhatted, tall, and thin man always dapper, becomes suspicious of Bernie. He believes his nice appearance is just a puton for the heartless deviant he really is.The character of Bernie is played by Jack Black, in a role that is beyond any description I can helpfully provide. His character needs to be seen. Black takes a character, whose story and personality is likely unknown to many people in 2012, and invents this kind, charismatic person in the blink of an eye. Bernie is perhaps the nicest movie character I have been greeted with this year, and even after he kills an old woman, its hard to even have harsh feelings for the sap. What he did was wrong, but it has become apparent that when a film features a coldblooded killer, we are robbed of backstory and reason as to why he is doing this or how he got here. We learn so much about Bernie and his life before the inevitable murder that we almost cant hate the man despite his unforgivable actions.Richard Linklater, who previously worked with Black in the impressive School of Rock, directs this black comedy with a serene bite, providing it with a rich script, and three lovable performances by three fine actors. Its deep south cinematography reminds me of the kind used in the drama Seven Days in Utopia, only more expressively used and healthier for the tone of the picture, not to mention the involving narrative carried throughout the excursion truly compliments the quiet rural nature of its setting. Bernie is one of the most enthusiastically quirky pictures of the year.Starring: Jack Black, Shirley Mac Laine, and Matthew Mc Conaughey. Directed by: Richard Linklater.",True
"Youre My Closest Adviser Greetings again from the darkness. A true tour de force by Forest Whitaker ... the best performance of the year so far! Somehow Mr. Whitaker captures the madness and charm of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Amin was one of the first political rock stars. He used the media to his advantage as his regime slaughtered hundreds of thousands of his countrymen.Also impressive is James Mc Avoy (Chronicles of Narnia) who plays the dramatized Nicholas Garrigan, a young doctor who sets out on an adventure to make a difference in a small country and ends up counseling one of the most powerful madmen in history. Scottish documentarian Kevin Macdonald directs the film with only a few lapses in directness, which serve this biopic very well. Watching Amin and the young doctor immerse themselves in the shower of power is both frightening and sickening. Macdonald captures this spirit very well thanks mostly to his willingness to let his two leads do their thing.As Amin laughs and tells Garrigan that You are my closest adviser, I couldnt help but compare to Kathy Bates telling James Caan (in Misery) that Im your number one fan. The evil and insanity is simply chilling. Whitaker is just amazing as he flips the switch from media darling to cold blooded, ruthless murderer ... and then back again. Just a terrific performance and well worth the price of admission  maybe a couple of times! Good for a laugh is the most unique version of Janis Joplins Me and Bobby Mc Gee that you have ever heard ... guaranteed! See this one for a bit of history and the site of a real monster, but also for one of the best film performances ever.",True
"What A Delightful Movie!Now this is the sort of movie Hollywood should be making! All the talent in these older actors and actresses and its being wasted by far too many tasteless, unfunny, crude movies that you either do not want to see, or if you are foolish enough to be roped into attending, you regret with every inch of your soul. In this one, each and every part was cast to perfection. A plot that made sense, fully fleshed out characters you like, and just fun, fun, fun. Tell you, there were more people in the matinée my friends and I went to see than for any movie we can remember seeing in a long time. And all of us left the show smiling. This one is a keeper. Would actually love to see a sequel to this, set a year or so ahead. I can think of several older actors/actresses to be in the film, in addition to these delightful players. Im hoping Hollywood is paying attention. Sometimes they do it right and use the real talent. The Best Oriental Marigold Hotel was one. Quartet was one. I could name a few more, too. And this is one. Looking for a nice break in some of the bleak stuff being offered? Here it is!",False
"El País de los Lobos Sicario describes, with surgical precision, the fatal and bloody desecration of Mexico as a result of its decades long cartel war. And it does so by compressing this almost endless tragedy into a twohour tourdeforce of filmmaking. At its center we find idealistic FBI Agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who is recruited to pursue a Mexican drugbaron. She is being guided by a seemingly untouchable covert assassin named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Their investigation and methods are pushed further into unknown territory where justice and morality are no longer valid. The end not only justifies the means, it requires them.Denis Villeneuves masterful piece exemplifies not only filmmaking of the highest order, but carves out a place alongside the terrible news reports as a deeply regretful, angry and at times almost unbearable look into the abyss of a sociopolitical nightmare that is fueled by first worldhabit and global economics.Through the powerful performances by Blunt, Del Toro and Josh Brolin in the leads as well as the excellent supporting cast, do we get a sense of the human cost (physical and psychological), which the war on drugs has taken.From an exploding prison population, to the destruction of Mexican agriculture, to refugees and a cycle of violence that is beyond barbarity; the pull that Sicario exerts over the viewer is undeniable and by skirting the limits of bearable tension, without ever becoming exploitive, it is never giving an inch concerning its subject matter.Few movies this year will have such a clear and defined structure and unflinching approach towards a situation that appears to be beyond salvation, while showing at the same time, that life nevertheless continues.Taylor Sheridans script doesnt miss a single beat and without sidestepping anything frees itself from beaten movie conventions by using familiar elements in an extremely skillful manner.All these themes, stories and characters are captured through the lens of veteran Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) who lets us always know how the micro and macroparticles of any conflict are inextricably intertwined. We share the vistas of beautiful sceneries while having to witness their downfall. Whatever ideals the likes of Emiliano Zapata once had, their country has now, as it is described in the movie, become the land of wolves. Fifteen years ago Steven Soderberghs Traffic which earned numerous Oscars, not the least of which went to Benicio Del Toro, made a clear statement about the various strands the drug trafficking business touches. Now, all those years later we see in Sicario that even the faintest of hopes that Traffic held onto have been eviscerated. What now? One might ask.",True
"Overhyped This review may be coming a little bit late, considering i saw the movie back in November, but i wanted to check one or two things before i write it.I wanted to see whether or not the movie will receive any Academy awards buzz from the the Golden Globes and the various Guild awards.I wanted to wait, because i could not believe the hype surrounding it.I saw it, and i was not that impressed at all.So after some amount of time has passed and the seven Academy nominations have been announced, i thought it was time for a second viewing, in order to try and change my mind about the movie, butno.First of all, i enjoyed Gone Baby Gone and The Town of Afflecks repertoire much more than i did with Argo.I would even recommend Zero Dark Thirty (Bigelows recent take on historical events, that are important to American society)ahead of Argo.That being said, Afflecks basedontruestoryscififlick has its strenghts.The fact that the movie is solid enough and that a thorough enough backgroundcheck on the events depicted in it, are made, admittedly do the movie some justice.Its well and accurately written, but a nomination is as far as it can stretch itself.Never mind the fact that Affleck is still weaker in front of the camera, than he is behind it, this is clearly visible.One might even wonder how he has that experience as an actor and as a director and be so far ahead with the material when at the helm of a movie.So, the era is accurately depicted, even the jokes, sets, clothing, musicall fits the bill, although Led Zeppelins When the Levee Breaks is probably 1012 years earlier, thus not from this period.But im willing to close my eyes on this one, considering the love i have towards Plant&co.On that subject, Aerosmith and Dream On were more accurately chosen, although only for the trailer.The technical part of the movie was almost excellent, i mean there isnt any breakout aspect to put in the running for some awards (although some people obviously think there is), all in all everything was good enough.Maybe only William Goldenberg can get a nod over the others, but hell have stiff competition from his other movie, Zero Dark Thirty and himself.As this is pretty evident by now, he has two nominations in one category for two different movies.So, it will be pretty interesting to see which movie do the critics hold in higher regardthis category will tell.For me, that should be Zero.So, technically good, historically accurate, even a little tense, so whats the matter, you might ask.Very simple.Contrary to popular belief, that has been planted in most peoples minds, there actually was no acting in this movie.Not a single part was properly played by nobody, including you, Mr. Arkin.I cant understand where did this nomination come from, but in my eyes it is totally undeserved.Arkin and Goodman were of course fine, fun to watch, but the parts they played, others have played so long ago and to a better extend.When we start off with Sunset Blvd. and stop at presentday Hank Moody, there are people much more prepared to the challenges of playing a movie guy.Arkin was fine, but for 10 minutes of screen time you just cant receive that kind of reception and you just cant make this big of an impact.It is not normal.Not that they are, those awards and guildmembers.So, if i have to sum it up in a nutshellthe screenplay was good enough, the directing was decent as well, the acting was stiff at best (im looking at you, Ben), the era was pretty impressively(although inaccurately storywise) depicted (still looking at you, Ben), the technical part was topnotch (William Goldberg), but all in all this does not make up for the masterpiece many of you claimed it to be.If i had to recommend it, i would, simply because of its mustsee basedontruestory(although if we have to go there, discussing how accurate it really is, wed be in for a long night) factor.But, as i said earlier, im not that impressed and there is nothing all that much to be impressed with.And Best Picture?No way!!My rate: 6.5/10",False
"Whats wrong with you?Greetings again from the darkness. This one has been on my radar since the Sundance Festival and all the raves about Elizabeth Olsens performance. After attending a screening last evening, I find myself at a loss to adequately describe not just her stunning turn, but also this unusual film from writer/director Sean Durkin.On the surface, this sounds like just another movie peeking inside a creepy cult that brainwashes, and psychologically and physically abuses women, and is led by a charismatic (and creepy) religious style figurehead. There are many similarities to the Mansonfamily story of which much has been published, but Mr. Durkin takes the film in a much different and very creative direction by concentrating on what happens to Martha (Olsen) after she escapes the cult.In the Q&A, Durkin states he did much research and found the most fascinating story to be that of a cult escapee and what she went through during her first three weeks of freedom. Martha sneaks out early one morning and places a panic call to her older sister, whom she hasnt communicated with in two years. Settling in to the lake house with big sis and new brotherinlaw, it becomes quite obvious that Martha doesnt know how to fit in society and has absolutely no interest in discussing her recent past.The sister is played very well by Sarah Paulson, and her husband is Hugh Dancy (so very good in Adam). This seemingly normal yuppie couple is trying to do right by Martha, but the fits of paranoia, outbursts of anger, and societal goofs are just too much for them.The genius of this film is in the story telling. The cinematic toggling between today and moments of time at the cult farm house leads the viewer right into the confused mind of Martha. We dont get much back story but its obvious she was ripe for cult world when she was chosen. We see how Patrick, the quietly charismatic leader, sings her a song and steals her heart ... she wants so much to belong. We also see how she bonds with the other women at the farm house, and ends up in a situation that seems to snap her out just enough so she finds the strength to leave. The editing of scenes between these two worlds in outstanding and serve to keep the viewer glued to the screen.Last year I raved about an independent film called Winters Bone. I chose it as one of the years best and it ended with some industry award recognition. I am not willing to say this film is quite at that level, but I will say that the younger sister of the Olsen twins, Elizabeth, delivers an incredible first feature film performance and Sean Durkin deserves an audience for his first feature film as writer/director. Another bond between the two indies is that John Hawkes plays the cult leader Patrick, and Hawkes was a standout in Winters Bone.There will undoubtedly be some debate about whether this is cutting edge independent filmmaking or just another snooty arthouse mindmesser. All I can say is, I hope the film grabs enough audience for the debate to matter ... it deserves it.",True
"What a wonderful idea!I went to see this movie hoping to get a brake from Hollywood production. And I did. It was amazing, one of the best movies Ive seen on big screen in 2 or 3 years.Plot consists of different stories which all have one thing in common: they are about revenge. Every single story starts rather boring. At the very beginning I was thinking Whats so wild about it? It is just lame and by the end of the intro I was like Holy God! No, they did not just twist it like that! OMG!And it gets better. A true masterpiece. I am from Russia so for me it was rather interesting and surprising that Latin America is so similar to Russia. The views, the behaviour of the people, the insanity  all like at home.You wont regret seeing this movie. Dont take your kid or your grandmother though.",False
"Quentin strikes again.Where does a director go after making two colossal worldwide hits?Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) were two of the greatest movies ever made, and they launched director Quentin Tarantino into the realm of Mainstream Hollywood Director. Most of the time, a director faced with this reality will sink into a slew of really bad movies, but so far Tarantino has been either extremely lucky or extremely talented  his third feature film, although lacking in the brutality of its predecessors, contains just as much wit. Based upon the Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch, its packed with the clever dialogue that Leonard is known for in his writing. Its also got a good amount of style, too. Its not a typical Tarantino movie, but is that necessarily a bad thing? In this particular instance, no.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight stewardess forced into running jobs for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a ruthless criminal who has no respect for life  or death, for that matter. However, during one of her smuggling efforts, a couple of FBI Agents (including Michael Keaton) nab her and offer her a deal: If she helps them get Ordell, she will be let free from custody. The Feds do not know who Ordell is, but they know he exists, and that is where Jackie comes in. She reluctantly agrees to participate in their sting operation, but all is not what it seems. And when $500,000 dollars disappears from his retirement fund, Ordell stops, thinks, and arrives upon the conclusion that we all anticipate with glee: Jackie Brown did it.His partner in crime, Louis (the wonderful Robert De Niro), also decides to doublecross Ordell, with the help of a sexy blonde ditz named Melanie (Bridget Fonda), The movies twisting plot line and intersecting story lines is very reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, and De Niros underrated performance is a real standout. The movies quite well made and enjoyable.Dont misinterpret what Im saying. This is no Reservoir Dogs, nor does it want to be. Its not in the same vein as Tarantinos other movies, at least not at a superficial level. However, it is extremely entertaining, helped along by a great cast and a terrific script. The only difference here is that Tarantino did not come up with everything by himself. He adapted the screenplay from another source, something he usually doesnt do. But theres also a littleknown fact that Roger Avary cowrote some of Dogs and Fiction with Tarantino, as well as sparked the idea for some of his films. Here, Quentin adapts Leonards novel and does justice. People who say it isnt as good as his other movies because its recycled obviously dont know what theyre talking about.Tarantino started out as a video store clerk, and is the movie buffs filmmaker. Not only does Tarantino share a deep passion for films, but he also knows what most of the real movie enthusiasts want. He has yet to disappoint me with any of his directorial efforts. His own life story would make an interesting movie, and indeed it did with True Romance, partially based on Tarantinos own selfimage of himself. (A geek working at a comic book store falls in love and goes off of an adventure into a new realm  in Tarantinos own case, it was filmmaking. For Clarence, from True Romance, it was drugs and murder.)Tarantino has a flair for raw energy in all of his films, and Jackie Brown is no exception. The movie is bursting at its edges, packed with wild antics and the occasional fierce brutality. The movie was criticized by Tarantinos diehard fans for being too different from his other films. However, the mistake of many directors is to repeat the same formulas over and over again. One must at least give Tarantino credit for trying new things in each of his films. If anything, the only thing that Tarantino likes to insert into all his films is a large source of energy. And is that a bad thing?4.5/5 stars.",True
"A Passionate Requiem I finally saw it ! As a total devotee of the two previous installments, I avoided seeing the third one, on purpose, people I respect had told me about the disappointment and, quite honestly, I didnt go there. Last night I did and surprise, surprise, it moved me no end. Maybe because I havent seen the other two in four years. Yes at times is more Ken Russell than Francis Ford Coppola and in my book thats not a bad thing. I was, however, a bit taken aback by the healing in Pacinos Michael as far as Keatons Kay is concerned. As it nothing had ever happened, while in Diane Keaton the memory of that pain is always present. Talia Shire is a lot of fun as a sort of Madame Sin. Raf Vallone, superb as the doomed Pope John Paul I and then a bit puzzling casting choices that I think they me code for something. George Hamilton, for instance, takes over from where Rubert Duvall left off. Helmut Berger plays the head of the Vatican Bank. Helmut Berger! Just as curious as to find Troy Donahue in The Godfather Part II  All in all, Im really glad Ive seen it and Im sure Ill see it again.",True
"One Of The Most Memorable Movies Of The 80s You dont hear much about this film anymore, but in its day, this was the mosttalked about movie of the year. It was a favorite topic of conversation about the office water cooler for a number of weeks. At the time, it was a shocker. Nowaways.....who knows? As we become more and more desensitized to violence, sex and profanity, it takes a lot more to shock us.Still, this movie had memorable moments that have stayed with us who first saw it at the theater 20 years ago. Most of those memorable scenes, if not all of them, involve Glenn Closes character, Alex Forrest. Man, this is a woman who would not be denied what she wanted: in this case, married man Michael Douglas.No sense going into all the details. Everyone knows them by now, anyway. Looking back, I think the film was a good lesson for men (or women) thinking about cheating on their spouses and assuming nothing bad will happen as a result. Men may commit more crimes, but that old adage about a woman scorned certainly is demonstrated here in spades! Douglas character, Dan Gallagher, certainly can attest to that, but he is anything but a sympathetic character. Both actors do a superb job in here, but kudos also to the rest of the Gallagher family, played by Anne Archer (wife Beth) and Ellen Hamilton Latzen (daughter Ellen.)Also, the cinematography shouldnt be overlooked. The widescreen DVD certainly brought out how nicely this film was shot and directed. This twohour film keeps your attention all the way. The only thing I would change is the language, toning it down a bit. Otherwise, its a classic thriller and one of the most famous films in the 80s.",True
"A Truly Magical Movie For All Ages, Burtons Finest This is one of Tim Burtons most powerful movies. Though the titlecharacter seems strange he represents the goodness in the world and what can happen when society just doesnt accept difference. The Gothic look of the castle, combined with the glorious colour of suburbia creates a strong contrast and shows things may not be as they seem. Edward comes from the dark and scary castle but is gentle, kind and loving, the place he wants to be accepted into is the colourful suburbia, which is backstabbing, vicious and evil. This story shows the betrayal of a person who desperately wants to help and to love but does not realise he is being used. The only people that seem to understand him are the wonderful Peg Boggs (played brilliantly by Dianne Wiest) and the beautiful Kim (played superbly by Winona Ryder). Tim Burton has created yet another beautiful fairy tale to captivate adults and children alike. Johnny Depp shows his great talent as an actor and Danny Elfmans music for the movie is some of the most beautiful youre ever likely to hear. A great movie for Christmas and all year round, and while it is a classic story it also deals with the prejudices of society, friendship, family and love and I advise anyone who hasnt seen it to see it, it is an experience well worth it and a movie youll never forget.",False
"Well crafted and seriously will strike a chord A novel of this genre is really difficult for film adaptation, its a difficult subject to project on as it has pain from start to end.Life is like that some moments we cherish some moments makes us cry,we laugh we cry,we celebrate we console,we fall in love we break it up and ultimately we end up on a sad note as we die.Thats the hardest truth.Well projected by the film.The subject of the film is not for everyone or every mood.Its not an entertainment grosser its a film about life,true love,jealousy,anger,helplessness,pain and courage.I will not mention individually about the actors performances as they all have equally done brilliant.Though a special mention should definitely go to the actors playing young Kathy,Ruth and Tommy.The music of the film is just awesome,the screenplay couldnt have been more better.I enjoyed the silent scenes too giving my imaginations to think for something.

"Worth watching Rather enjoyed this film at the Rome Film Festival last night. The atmosphere of New York by night and the soundtrack itself made it worth the half an hour delay getting in! The main performances are strong, Keira puts in a surprisingly convincing interpretation as the wife who meets her previous love the day her husband is out of town with a female colleague he likes. It discusses the nature of love, betrayal, marriage and sentiment in a thoughtful way, without the usual labelling of people as cheaters and victims. It should encourage us to realise that life and relationships are more complex and that ultimately, nobody really belongs to anyone (however much we might like to think we do). Its a shame these days that we only get to see the lives of the beautiful, very welltodo folk (in their wonderful apartments, sipping on fine wine) on the big screen as if temptation within marriage was a luxury that only the wealthy and obscenely photogenic can afford. Anyway, universal themes are dealt with well and its good fodder for a long conversation afterwards.",True

"Best Movie of 2011Saw this at a local film festival with little to no information about the movie whatsoever; little did I know this was going to become my favorite film of the year, and thats saying a lot given that 2011 has been a blast for moviegoers with new products by Woody Allen, Terrence Malick, Lars Von Trier and Clint Eastwood.The movie revolves around an poignant substitute teacher (perfectly played by Adrien Brody) who arrives at a vicious school, where students go around bullying people (including the teachers) and basically throwing their lives directly to the dumpsteryou know, teenage angst and suchI didnt grow up in the USA, so two important things I must say, a) I dont know if this is an accurate depiction of any given school in America and b) I cant relate with the overall chronicle, which brings me to my next point.The beauty of this movie comes within the subtext, whether you can directly relate with the characters or not, the movie takes the message and widens its range so everyone is able to understand the actual meaning of the film. Lets clear things out, this film is not about a school or the basis of education, this is about trying our best not to give a damn about others as most of us just go around doing everything in our power to be happy ourselves with a lousy job, a loveless marriage, a constant sense of abandonment or basically a crappy life (all of the above portrayed marvelously in the film).Films by Tony Kaye tend to be really visceral with a thin slice of optimism in the undertones, I think this time he just went mental about everything, in the end youll leave the theater with a slight sense of hopelessness, almost as if youre destined to watch daily misery without the power to control anything but your own life, as if the only battle you must fight is the constant reminder that even when everything falls apart and slowly turns into dust, you cant change the world, you just have to avoid the world from changing youThis exposed stunningly in the final sequence of the movie.Do yourself a favor, watch this film!",False
"Wonderful Movie about Love, Genius and Great Jazz Guitar Playing As Woody Allen said of Sean Penn after working with him on this film (Seans) a tremendous actor. And he displays his tremendous talent in playing the role of Emmett Ray, jazz guitarist, a genius at his craft, rather a disastrous dope in all other aspects of his life.Then theres Samantha Morton who is brilliant in her portrayal of sweet, adorable Hattie, a cute mute young woman whose simple needs and wants, along with her lack of narcissism and inability to spew out mind numbing volumes of bulls+t banter obscure her deep strength and savvy intelligence. Those that value pure, sweet, unassuming kindness will find her irresistibly lovable.Emmett only really knows one thing, how to play guitar like no one else in the world, with the exception of the one person he idolizes to the point of hysteria: Django Reinhardt. Hes obliviously inept at just about everything else in his life, especially his feelings, to the point where he doesnt know real, rare, wonderful love when its right next to him. Sean is able to make Emmett so very likable, even in his worst of behavior. He excels at what he does best, bringing real human depth and qualities to his craft that exceptionally few actors are or have been capable of doing.This film is much like the character of Hattie, deceptive in its initial appearance and of a substantially better quality than you may first think. It seems like a light, cute little story largely due to its entertaining presentation and lack of dramatic pretense but there is significant texture and reality to this work of art. Emmett is perhaps the greatest guitar player in America and has so many of the essential ingredients for huge success: drive, ambition, presentation, wardrobe, personality, yet he tends to sabotage himself frequently and never gets the lucky break needed to put him at the top. True he could probably do rather well if he didnt p+ss away such volumes of cash but he never gets the type of success that the best supposedly deserve and is so wrought with money it wont disappear in the most extravagant lifestyles.Emmett also makes the tragically universal mistake of believing bullsh+t, both his and societys. He thinks the money and possessions and trophy girlfriends are what happiness are all about. His one saving grace is his love and respect for his craft but can this alone keep him from making a disaster of his life? He discovers all too painfully that the beautiful woman with the sophisticated, witty repartee, whom all the other men drool over, has an extremely high price tag of impenetrable, cold blooded narcissism. And though Emmett acts for the most part like a shallow dope, trying to hide and deny that besides being a genius he is a painfully sensitive man in desperate need of sweet, nurturing love, he still makes way too many foolhardy decisions. He is blind to the fact that the women who use sweetness merely as a tool of manipulation are the last thing he, or anyone else with a shred of decency, need or deserve.This is a great film and story and you can also enjoy a very pretty picture of life in the 1940s while you watch it.Apparently there was an obscure jazz guitarist named Emmett Ray but even if there wasnt, this is not really a fictionalized account. Certainly not in the sense of capturing the essence of character, love and genius. As he has done so marvelously before and since, Woody Allen masterfully captures an immensely watchable slice of life that most of us will only have an opportunity to witness with this fine offering. For the film itself as well as the two stellar leads this is will go into my relatively short list of wonderful, favorite films.",False
"Excellent A lonely Vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as a taxi driver in the dirty streets of New York, where he encounters a young prostitute who he tries to help make a difference. This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best (Goodfellas being my fave). An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Traviss mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia. This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle You talking to me? Well Im the only one here. and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after its finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70s. An unsettling gem of a film. 5/5",True
"Not just a classic of the 80s, but of any decade Matthew Broderick looked so brilliant in those days. While this film single handedly made him Ferris Bueller forever, at least this is a film that can be seen all throughout the years without dating too badly. Sure, the music and props will signify a time of discontent and bad hairdos, but the idealistic look of a man simply wanting to ditch school has never been made more daringly and charmingly. Everything about this film was gold, from the postmodern conversations with the audience to the little back stories which seem to shape the overall canvas of the film. While Alan Ruck was way too old to play in this movie, at least he proved to be a great opposite to the cool and nonchalant Ferris. Grossout comedies may now be the norm, at least we can look back to this film and enjoy a good, genuine laugh.",False

"Bible study I cried my eyes out, so maybe I shouldnt raise any objections, but... many things in this beautifully made movie were more simplistic than they needed to be.The priest called Marys attention to commands in the Bible she obviously wasnt taking literally in her life: we should stone disobedient children to death, we shouldnt eat shellfish. She then looks up these passages and tells the priest she has read them, and continues to raise questions about his reasoning. But earlier in the movie the family amuses itself with Bible quizzes  I say a phrase, you tell me the book and chapter its from. How could a woman who clearly knew the Bible better than she knew her own son not already have read Deuteronomy and Leviticus backwards, forwards, and inside out? For a selfconvinced Christian like Mary, the contradictions between the passages in the Bible she liked and the ones she didnt like would have been explained away long before the events of this story.Also, as another poster has said, the story didnt really lead us to understand why the boy did what he did. Theres a hint that his boyfriend was seeing other guys, he got a really nasty birthday present from his mother, he was very lonely at the hospital where he worked, but  the dots werent really connected. It felt like a couple of scenes had been cut, with the effect that at the climactic moment I found myself asking Wha? instead of feeling the horrible inevitability of it.Why am I criticizing a movie that gave me the best cry Ive had in months? Because movies on Lifetime, even the best ones, always pull back from the edge. There is always at least to some degree an ironedout, homogenized, Canadianlocationized blandness to the storytelling (even though this one wasnt shot in Canada.) What if they let a movie actually be itself? What if they aimed for Sundance quality nuance, naturalism, emotion, unexpectedness in storytelling?

They are hard to watch, especially when they mix real characters that live their lives sometimes awaken, or inside one big dream or their own dreams.Axel Blackmar (Johnny Depp) is a dreamer, and an unusual example of personal choices. His parents died and he went to New York, to work with fish. He could have sold cars with his uncle Leo (Jerry Lewis), but hes there, talking with that monotonous voice about what he does. Maybe it was a simple dream, where an Eskimo catches a fish with two eyes on the same side, and tells his kids to go out with their dog so he and his wife canAnd the kid with the dog allow to see an orange balloon that seems to go from Alaska to New York, where Alex sleeps in a truck. Wake up, Columbus, the words of his mother and Axels hope to find something in the land already discovered by that man.Alongside fish flying through the air, we join Axel to be the best man of his uncles wedding. With his friend Paul Leger (Vincent Gallo), the untiring chats go from movies to philosophies about cakes, pies and bananas. Paul is an actor: Im having a great performance on Friday, he says. Its an audition, Axel says to humiliate him. The truth is that its not even an audition. This stuff lived by Axel is a story for us, but is a personal rediscovering and rethought of decisions in life for the character. When he sees Elaine (Faye Dunaway) he feels something strong, but doesnt know how to call it. Days later he becomes the lover of a woman decades older than him. Elaines daughter, Grace (Lili Taylor) is also there, and it doesnt goes long until Axel finds himself in a crossroad between the heart of two women, that as he describes them, are too similar and big to be in the same world.David Atkins story and screenplay comes plagued of phrases that could come out of a lunatics mouth, but they fit in the films context and twist your head at maximum. Ive got to climbIts a long way to the moon; Im gonna live forever until I become a turtleThey have infinite lives, besides scenes of well known movies in crucial moments. And what music (Goran Bregovic)! And what editing (Andrija Zafranovic)! And what cinematography (Vilko Filac)! And what director! Known for his originality, recognized director Emir Kusturica puts his own signature to his movie, collaborating in the story he must have dreamed a little to; giving life to the dream with his flying camera, full of unexpected turns and in love of its surroundings. What he achieves is greater words, although not everybody could understand it, and, for that matter, appreciate it.And his actorsJerry Lewis in a total comprehension of his character, and so involved in his work that you wouldnt believe it. So incredibly likable in one of those roles we never give much importance to. Faye DunawayWow! She got to work with some of these actors later, but here, as an old woman in character and, with respect, in person, she maintains that virtue of creating uniqueness, with her laughs, smiles and way of saying things. Lili Taylor was the most interesting character here. The silent daughter that could be crazy but no one can really tell. With imagination and freedom, Taylor makes her character believable and not as overacted as it might be. Vincent Gallo, who I respect mostly as a director and as an actor that does what he wants, the ability he has had to choose his roles is visible here again; as he shines without lights to help him. A wonderful performance his fans shouldnt miss.But DeppHow can I explain? Ive said it a lot, surely, but I will repeat it. Hes like a magician, but not with the cards and the hat and the tricks. He is with his face, his looks, his way of talking, his perfection of movementBut its not really something technical: in the acting world, Johnny Depp is a magician. Im sure he still has plenty of that for us, but here is where he let us know first.In one scene, Vincent Gallos character Paul, an actor, requests that no one touches his face, because its important. Do you think they touch Brandos face? Do you think they touch Pacinos, De Niros? Do you think they touch Johnny Depps face? I dont know then, but not know; and if they did before, they shouldnt have.",False
A movie that touches your heart!This movie made me very happy.

This is a very optimistic movie and I sincerely believe that we need more films like Curly Sue.  It touched my heart.,False
"Cronenberg finally settled in his new direction Ever since Cronenberg started making straight movies without (too many) splatter elements, something in his oeuvre had been lacking. Spider was beautifully photographed but a complete and utter bore. The much praised A History Of Violence had a great cast and a solid premise, but turned out to be just as boring and on top of that farfetched and superficial. Eastern Promises finds Cronenberg finally coming to terms with his new realistic approach to movie making.Its a little wonder that there havent been too many serious movies about the Russian Mafia, yet, so having a movie that takes place in these circles is fascinating all by itself. Cronenberg sets the story up slowly, but nicely. He never falls into the trap of slowing things down too much as he did with his previous two movies. Cronenberg also avoids getting too close to the style of the genres Big Kahuna, Martin Scorsese. This is a completely original effort, which sets it apart from 2007s snorefest American Gangster, that didnt contribute anything new to the gangster genre at all.The cast is, of course, very helpful. Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassell look threatening, coldblooded and emotional all at the same time. You really forget the actors and start looking at them as the characters they embody. Armin Mueller Stahl who plays the gangster boss wasnt quite as convincing. During the movie we hear all those cruel and crazy things hes done, but when we see him on screen we cant really imagine that hes capable of all that. The weakest link in the cast, however, is Naomi Watts, who plays the same way she always does and comes across as pretty onedimensional. She has deservedly gotten a lot of praise for Mullholland Dr. but failed to present a comparably great performance ever since. Shes just good enough not to ruin the intensity of this movie.Eastern Promises is aesthetic, explicit and thrilling. There are some scenes you wont forget for weeks to come (the sauna fight, the opening sequence). In short, what we have here is a modern classic. One of last years finest and possibly the best movie David Cronenberg has made so far.",False
"Enjoyable Cemetery Junction is Ricky Gervaiss second attempt at directing a major motion picture. A fan of his previous work in television but having been disappointed by The Invention of Lying I was not sure what to expect. The final result was a 95 minute movie that was flawed yet very fun to watch and something to lose yourself in for a short period of time.The plot of Cemetery Junction evolves around three young men in 1973 who are desperately trying to avoid spending the rest of their lives in working class Reading and ending up like their parents. The film itself is mainly a drama but there is plenty of wellplaced, classic Gervais comedy throughout. The majority is setting the scene and developing the characters. However, this leads to the final twenty minutes seeming quite rushed with slightly choppy editing and throwing in a few clichés which it had previously done a good job of avoiding. The acting was brilliant for the most part, but I felt Christian Cooke (who probably has the most screen time out of the trio of friends) was a little wooden. Overall, Cemetary Junction is an enjoyable film that should please Gervais fans yet can be more widely appreciated as he is attempting to do something different and, in my opinion, does a pretty good job of it.7/10",False
"i enjoyed this movie much more than i expected...having read all of the reviews of this new experiment from Harmony Korine, i was prepared for a rough, baffling, and possibly somewhat painful moviegoing experience.  the truth is, though, that i not only found this movie completely watchable, but i found it to have a STRONG emotional core and a cohesive thematic tract (and very funny, in parts...though i can never tell with Korine what is supposed to be funny and what is not).  dont get me wrong: this is by no stretch conventional drama.  in fact, theres hardly any drama here at all (the closest thing to real drama comes in the scenes with Werner Herzogs unbelievably abusive character).  the emotion here comes from something that i can only call purely cinematic.  the downright abstract editing juxtaposed with the hyperrealism of the Dogma 95 camerawork really makes for an intense visual experience.  and the individual scenes tend to make more sense than in Korines previous work (particularly Gummo). certainly, some of the scenes seem a bit excessive.  i suppose if you tried to view this (or any of Korines work) as some kind of social commentary, then you would inevitably be offended at some of the things here.  but this isnt social commentary; this world on the screen is by no means a convincing depiction of the real world.  every person on the screen is somehow sick or outcast, and i guess the major theme of the film is simply how we deal with our individual sicknesses.  i guess this is a film that if you have a strong interest in seeing it in the first place, then you will really get something out of it.  if you have no interest in seeing it, then chances are youll never even hear about this movie (and youll never read this commentary).  for my money, Harmony Korine is no dilettante (and no slut!); he is one of the few true individuals making movies today.",False
"Slow and lowkey but describes its characters with wit I saw the movie at the Helsinki International Film Festival. It tells a story about an old man who is certain that he has won a million dollars and wants to get to Nebraska to collect it. His family is sure that it is a hoax but his son chooses to drive him there so that the thing wouldnt bother his dad anymore. Everything about the movie is very low key and the pacing is quite slow. This comes from the choice of shooting it in black and white, style of acting, and the locations and events depicted in the film. For long periods, I found it a little hard to get immersed into the events on the screen and empathize with the characters. I kept thinking that the movie repeats what I did not like about Alexander Paynes earlier work About Schmidt. But then somehow the movie started to grow on me. I still feel there is almost weird resemblance to the road trip and family reunion Jack Nicholsons character goes through in About Schmidt but Nebraska has merits of its own. For one, the characters are quite well written. Even the supporting roles provide witty observations of different ways we might react to other persons fortune. Also, the acting is very good throughout the film. The main characters lives have become unsatisfying and they are trying to deal with it in different ways. Even though it is a little frustrating to watch people who struggle to find anything meaningful to do or say, the script and the actors are able to draw a very accurate picture of everyday life as it sometimes can be. Here and there, they are able to provide a few laughs and even some satisfaction when the characters are developing, albeit slowly.Overall, Id end up recommending the film if you have enjoyed Alexander Paynes previous work.",True
"Great movie.Watched this movie knowing nothing about it, and with the name wild bill, though it was one of those silly lets kill everyone movies, but i was absolutely engrossed by this movie from the first 5 mins, great storyline, and great acting, and being from this part of London myself, it catches the essence of life in the London ghetto life, and towards the end of the movie you really feel for the lead character and find yourself getting chocked up for the guy.8 out of 10 from me, and im normally a hard critic of English films as there been so much rubbish in the last few years coming out of england.Im fully intent to watch this film again, and this time take my wife so she can see what i was raving about to her about this film.

"It isnt the play, but it is a very good film I first encountered Cat in a fine National Theatre production in 1988 with Lindsay Duncan as Maggie, Ian Charleson as Brick, Eric Porter as Big Daddy, Paul Jessons as Gooper and Alison Steadman as Mae.  The film is not the play, but you dont often get an opportunity to see a fine cast perform this amazing play, and it needs a fine cast.The movie has a fine cast. The movie grips you from start to finish.  The movie even adds a little; the basement scene works wonderfully in the movie in ways that would be hard or impossible to reproduce on stage.Yes, the play has been bowdlerised to make it into a movie, but what do you expect in 1958.  The reality is, this film is a piece of cinema and drama history.  Youd need to be a Williams Fundamentalist to hate the movie for its toneddownness.  To the balanced Williams fan, it is gripping, well acted and nicelypaced.  Once every 1015 years there is a truly fine production of this play in a worldclass theatre.  If you get the chance, go see a great production in the theatre.  In between times, this movie is a very good second.",False
"If Your Life Sucks Watch This Movie I am not an animal! I am a human being! I am a man!John Merrick (as portrayed in The Elephant Man)If Your Life Sucks, Watch this Movie The Elephant Man, directed by David Lynch and written by Sir Frederick Treves and Ashley Montagu, is a macabre story about Dr. Frederick Freddie Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who shows compassion for a man with Proteous Syndrome John Merrick (John Hurt). The story is based on the true account of John Merricks life as a side show freak in the nineteenth century. The viewer is taken on a journey of a man trying to regain some selfrespect and the doctor who is helping him to do so.If you are like me and in a bad space in your life, watch this movie. Although a depressing film there are brief moments of hope with the interaction of Merrick and Treves. But, mostly it is scene after scene of abuse, torture and the dark side of human nature. This is not a movie that a viewer is going to want to watch time and time again. Watching this movie is like being drug through a crime scene, most dont want to look but most cant help themselves. After viewing the film, I felt a lot better about my life, and right now I am unemployed, fat and alone.That being said, the movie taken as a work of art was excellent. The black and white cinematography really added to the Victorian feel of the nineteenth century. The character development was superb and the acting of Hopkins and Hurt phenomenal. The makeup and costuming was dark as the film itself and the direction by Lynch, using his signature dream scenes only added to the dimness of the entire film. I highly recommend this film once because it is beautifully directed and a great story. But, unless you are a masochist, once is enough.",True
"All things truly wicked start from an innocence Ernest Hemingway I was so excited my theater got The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, from the moment I saw this trailer, I knew I was in for a treat. This movie just looked incredible, even though its a touchy subject with the holocaust, it still looked like it was going to be a great story. Everyone always makes a comment about the innocence of childhood, what it was like to just not have reason, to just go with the flow of things before adults tell you what you have to do. So I watched The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas today and this movie seriously is one of the saddest films I have ever seen, but I felt it was very maturely handled. The actors are great and the story is very touching, to watch these two boys from two completely different worlds who come together just to have fun, be boys, not because of the difference of their background.Set during World War II, a story seen through the innocent eyes of Bruno, the eightyearold son of the commandant at a concentration camp, whose forbidden friendship with a Jewish boy on the other side of the camp fence. The boys have a great friendship talking every day, enjoying the company. But when the father gives Bruno a Nazi propaganda loving tutor, Bruno becomes confused, is his father an evil man or is his friend the evil one? Love his country and do his duty or dont judge and just stay true to his friend? Bruno must decide all this with some scary consequences ahead of him.The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a fantastic film, though if you see it, I do recommend bringing the tissues. I couldnt believe the chemistry they had with these two young actors, they worked so well together as these innocent boys who both have no idea whats going on. Bruno doesnt know why his friend is behind fences, and his friend doesnt know why hes there either. The ending is extremely powerful and the story keeps you interested. I do recommend seeing The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, its a treasure from 2008.9/10",False
"Pink flower arrangements Jim Jarmusch returns to the screen with an immensely pleasing film that looks extremely simple, but in fact, its what is not being said that really is at the center of the picture. Mr. Jarmusch is one director that loves to work with an economy of everything. His films seem to be crying for a set decorator, but that is misleading, because its the simplicity that seems to work in most cases.If you havent seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.At the center of the story is Don Johnston, whose name seems to provoke in most people a recognition by associating it to the actor, Don Johnson. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Don is a taciturn man, who when we meet him is being dumped by his last girlfriend. Don Johnston, with his deadpan demeanor, appears to be a man that has gone through life on auto pilot. In fact, when he receives the letter that will, in a way, change his life, he doesnt even react. His solution to the problem is to show this letter to his next door neighbor, Winston. Little does Don knows, but Winston maps out a plan to get him involved in the solution of the mystery he is presented. We accompany Don in a trip of discovery to reacquaint himself with former lovers who might have been instrumental in sending the pink letter.Thus we meet Laura, the closet organizer, a widow now, living with a precocious daughter, Lolita, who seems to have jumped from the Nabokovs book, in all her precociousness. Then, there is Dora, the real estate woman who lives in a development in which all the houses look alike. We meet Carmen, the pet communicator, a sort of animal analyst who has turned her love interest another way. Finally, we are given a glimpse of Penny, who couldnt care less to see Don one more time.The opening sequence that sets the story in motion is nothing but perfection. We watch the fateful letter at the beginning when its being dropped in the mail box right up to its delivery through Dons mail slot.Jim Jarmusch, and his amazing cast have done wonders with this film. Bill Murray is sensational as the jaded Don Johnston. Once again, this actor clearly shows he is at the top of the game. Jeffrey Wright, one of the best young actors working in films and in the theater these days, makes a valuable contribution as Winston. The women in Dons life are fantastic. Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Julie Delpy, Tilda Swinton, and Jessica Lange are seen at their best. Finally, two excellent turns by Alexis Dziena as Lolita and Chloe Sevigny as an assistant to Carmen.Mr. Jarmusch has created a film that says a lot about how modern relationships are being practiced these days.",False
"Familiar story of murder and smalltown secrets THE SILENCE is a German murder mystery thats heavily indebted to two separate sources: firstly, the whole look and mood of the currentlypopular Scandinavian cop shows (such as THE KILLING), from which the style of music is frequently ripped off (like that whole thing with a single, deep note held for a while). Meanwhile, the plot and police investigation bear more than a hint of the exceptional South Korean drama, MEMORIES OF MURDER.What follows is predictable but occasionally highly gripping, and strangely enough different subplots in the movie have different levels of interest. I admit that I found the whole police investigation to be pretty dull; there isnt actually much investigating taking place, and it all seems very slow and stately. The scenes of grieving parents are so familiar by now that they didnt affect me at all.A second, alternate part of the film follows the friendship between two men, one of whom is a paedophile and murderer. This part of the film is exceptionally, dealing with dodgy subject matter in an intensely gripping way. Ulrich Thomsen (from THE THING remake) and Wotan Wilke Mohring are both very good here, and I would have much preferred the whole film to concentrate on these two by doing away with the predictable police stuff altogether. However, what were left with is a real film of two halves; ones powerful stuff indeed, and the others best forgotten.",True
"Great Movie and Even greater Performance You dont know jack is one of the greatest movie of 2010. It Shows the life of Jack Kevorkian. If you remember the 90s than you should have a picture of Dr Jack Kevorkian in your mind. He was just as famous as any movie star. He was the daily subject of medical discussion, The Movie Shows what truly was the intention of Dr Jack Kevorkian and how he released countless people from their misery. Barry Levinson directed the movie amazingly, and as for the performance Every one performed excellent. But Al Pacino Truly stole the show, he proved why he is considered the greatest of all time by many. He lost over 20 pounds for this movie and developed a physique so different than what he originally posses. Its amazing that he was able to pull of such a physically demanding task at the age of 70. AL out did himself with each and every scene. John Goodman, Brenda Vaccaro, Danny Huston, Susan Sarandon, Cotter smith and Logan all did outstanding job in this Epic movie.

What is the connection between Vicente and Vera?La Piel que Habito is an intriguing and dark film of revenge and obsession by Pedro Almodóvar that recalls George Franjus Les Yeux Sans Visage (Eyes without a Face) but in a David Cronenbergs style. It was very difficult for me to write the plot summary without spoilers since the screenplay is very well developed like a puzzle and the mystery is kept along most part of the story. The gorgeous Elena Anaya has a great performance in her ambiguous role. Antonio Banderas and Marisa Paredes are wonderful, as usual. Ending my review, I would like to write that even those viewers that have never seen a film by Almodóvar will enjoy La Piel que Habito.

"Superb, emotive filmmaking Im very sorry I didnt get to see this film in the theatre. It is a beautifully filmed masterpiece with a superb story, excellent acting (esp. Nick Nolte), and a great script. It takes things way deeper than Saving Private Ryan or most other modern war movies dare to go. Very introspective and dreamy at times, with the camera constantly dwelling on faces, animals, and the landscape. Merrick is never in a hurry, and this pace suits the film well.The Thin Red Line asks a lot of good questions about death, war, and the ultimate meaning of life. Now that I have seen it, Im very surprised that this film did not win picture of the year. Spielbergs film was a gritty, realistic portrayal of war. But it was also highly commercial and had a very contrived plot. In comparison, this film sort of wanders through itself and in the process helps to put you in the boots of the soldiers it portrays.My only criticism is perhaps the film was a bit long, but I never noticed that the second time through. I cant praise this film enough. Excellent work.",False
"A masterpiece  my number 1 favorite Superman the greatest superhero of all time Superman: The Movie (1978) is a masterpiece of one of the greatest superhero Superman of all time. It is my number 1 favorite Superman of all time. I love, love, love, love this movie to death and even more so much I love it!!! This is a classic the best the original origin story of how a young boy grow up to become the greatest superhero as: superman of all time. Christopher Reeve is the only Clark Kent/Superman a great reporter who make fool of him self, his the best, his performance of Superman was written on his skin.He was a good heart person. It is sad That Christopher Reeve died in October 10, 2004 and I really miss the actor. I was in high school sophomore that year when I heard Christopher Reeve died I was sad. This movie has elements in the film that works. Special effects, great acting from everyone, great plot and story. It is going to be 40 years anniversary since this movie come out in December 10 1978. Superman: The Movie was Nominated for 3 Oscars, 17 wins & 18 nominations.I grew up watching Christopher Reeve as Superman saving the world and saving us, I believed in Superman. Superman: The Movie defines my childhood it is a classic and one of the best superhero movies of all time. From the comics and movies. This movie has heart, soul, adrenalin and it is a joy ride trough whole movie. Superman for me is an adventure, scifi, romance and a disaster film which was an earth quake after a bomb explode and Superman was racing against time to fix things and saving people. We dont see fighting or war movies in which superhero fights in here, but normal mother of nature disaster earth quakes.Why is this movie so good:  We found out more about planet Krypton and how Jor El with his wife Lara sent Kal El to planet Earth.We see Clark growing up and we see his first love Lana Lang. Susannah York played excellent as Kal Els mom she was also in the sequel. Diane Sherry Case was good as Lana Lang but the actress was forgotten she didnt had much screen time in this movie.Marlon Brando was excellent as Jor El he is incredible father figure to Superman. I love the actor and his performance from The Godfather (1972) to Apocalypse Now (1979) to Superman (1978) he is incredible. Director Richard Donner directs perfectly and excellent this masterpiece of origin story and it is a joy watching it.Here we also find that man of steel no fire, no bullets no iron or steel, no ice nothing can hurt him but only kryptonite green meteorite can hurt him.We have 3 villains here: Lex Luthor, Otis and Eve Teschmacher and they are good in their roles. The film has a lighter tone and humor thanks to Gene Hackmans performance and Ned Beatty they not so horrible evil villians but comic and funny at times. Valerie Perrine is the only Eve Teschmacher for me and Lex Luthor is Gene Hackman no one else.Margot Kidder is Lois Lane who become love interest for Superman but Clark never reveals his secret, thats what I love about this film. No one knows who is superman but us audience.I love how Superman saves those children on the bridge in the bus, or how Superman helped a helpless young girl getting her cat back from a tree. Superman saved all the passengers in a airplane. Superman stops a cat burglar. Christopher Reeve doesnt kill anyone the new Superman Henry Cavill kills people twists necks, while Chrispoher Reeve saves people he saves the world and he saves Lois Lane, Jimmy Olson and of course he stops Lex Luthor. Ms. Teschmacher saves Superman from drowning I love that so much.John Williams made a beautiful score for the Superman music theme even today people talk about the music and this movie. Hans Zimmer score for Man of Steel cant come near this movie score.10/10 I hate Henry Cavills Superman! Christopher Reeve is the greatest super hero and Superman of all time for me.

Adam has been a vampire for centuries but is tired with the fate of the world taken by wrong decisions of mankind. He has a confidentiality agreement with Ian (Anton Yelchin) that provides rare instruments to him and does not ask questions to him. Adam poses of Dr. Faust and buys blood bags from Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright) in a nearby hospital. His wife and lover Eve (Tilda Swinton) lives in Tangier, Moroccos, and is also a vampire. Her best friend is Kit Marlowe (John Hurt) that supplies blood for her that he buys from a French doctor.When Eve calls Adam from Tangier, she feels that he is down and she decides to fly to Detroit to meet him. She meets Kit to say goodbye to him and Kit tells Eve that he had a dream with her younger sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska). Eve and Adam reunite and spend the nights making love. Out of the blue, the wild and reckless Ava comes to Adams house and turns their lives upsidedown.Only Lovers Left Alive is a stylish and original vampire movie with a story of eternal love and music. The plot has no clichés and is developed in slow pace, with charismatic characters, great performances and entertaining dialogs. I dare to say that Only Lovers Left Alive is in 2014 what The Hunger was in 1983. Fans of gore or conventional vampire movies will probably not like this feature.

"Dont miss.  This deserves your attention.Zhang Yimou has crafted a beautifully shot and compelling story set inside horrific events. About all I knew of this movie was it was set in 1937 China and starred Christian Bale. Not knowing much allowed me to be completely open to the journey of the characters. This is an emotionally powerful story about people caught in circumstances for which there seems no hope of survival. The Japanese soldiers are shown as barbaric, but we do meet an officer who attempts to remain honorable though he must do his duty to his superiors. The violence in the movie is brutal, but not graphic or gratuitous. The choices and sacrifices made by the characters never seemed contrived. The arc of Christian Bales character may seem predictable, but it is never false or convenient to the story. All actors are excellent. Because theyre foreign to me I had no idea who they are or their other work. At the screening I attended we were introduced to Ni Ni, who said this was her first film. She is both beautiful and compelling. I wish her a long career. Yimou, through his daughter, told us about his journey to make this movie  based on a novel, based on real events.

Another universal conspiracy everybodys part of and no one knows about because all the good guys get murdered in a very complicated way.

"Cinematic Art achieved One of the best films in years, and in artistic cinematic terms, one of the best films Ive ever seen. Thats a heavy statement to make, but off the top of my head, I cannot think of another film that explores the inner workings of a character so intimately and believably, while blending cinematography, sound effects, and musical score in such harmony  but in a fashion we (as Americans at least) are not trained to enjoy. I felt the French influence strongly cinematically and, of course in the dialogue, but the writing and acting was so fluid it felt like the subtitles werent even there. The film deals with a rare physical condition, and I was physically there with the character from start to finish. I felt each moment as if it were my own. That is a rare accomplishment in cinema. Julian Schnabel directed a stellar cast. Mathieu Amalric was unusually charming as Jean Dominique Bauby, and Max Von Sydow was heartbreaking as his lonely widower father. The female leads were all equally impressive as they were beautiful. I don not mean to generalize them, but they were all so excellent that they blend seamlessly in my mind, in terms of performance.Overall, this film was as pure a cinematic experience as Ive witnessed in a long time. A true artist turns out a film that is truly a piece of art. Julian Schnabel takes his time in between films, but with work like this, theres no need to rush. Like a good painting, one can enjoy it for a lifetime.",False
"Mc Queens epic is beautiful and tragic anchored by sensational performances...Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)One of the things that have been thrown around for months now is the notion that awards season voting bodies wont respond to it because its too difficult to sit through. Lets define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? Id argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of too difficult around.Ive watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29year history and Ive seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielbergs Schindlers List can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass United 93, which is almost an emotional biopic of Americas darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ, one of the highest grossing films of alltime, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, its too hard watch. Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someones ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I cant answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didnt just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.Now when approaching the powerful film by Mc Queen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that Mc Queen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a lifelesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.I have long admired the talent thats been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. Ive known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.As Edwin Epps, Solomons last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the Amon Goeth of our tale, he is exactly what youd expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. Hes vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.Mark my words; Lupita Nyongo is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful Patsey at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. Youre watching the birth of a star.Hans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus Mc Garvey as one of the most innovative and exciting D Ps in the business. Especially following his work in The Place Beyond the Pines earlier this year. Simply marvelous.Oscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscars in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. Theres also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his masters house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I havent seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this difficult watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, theres no reason it cant top the night. Im very aware that seeing this film along with Steve Mc Queen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as Mc Queen and Ridley take in 12 Years a Slave? I remain hopeful.",False
"How Refreshing!Love, Simon is a very touching, heartwarming story about a relatable teenager with a big secret. This film is entirely relatable for anyone who has been in high school.

The characters are all wellthought out and the story is very funny, interesting, and emotional. This is a film for everyone!",False
"A superb debut from this team  Brilliant piece of film making Set against the complex backdrop of the beginnings of Northern Ireland in 71 but before Bloody Sunday really turned the tide in the favour of the IRA in 72 this is an extremely well made taught piece of drama. With an assured performance by rising star Jack O Connell in the lead, he plays a young soldier Gary Hook recently deployed to Northern Ireland who finds himself out of his dept when going on his first patrol thanks to the incompetence of his CO (Sam Reid)  Separated from his unit and lost in a city he doesnt know hes forced in a fight for survival as its hard to tell who is friend and who is foe in this extremely well written piece of drama. The writer here has taken care not to paint one side entirely good or bad and that is how it was. Wounded and armed with nothing but a knife Hook has enemies closing in from all sides as the film draws to a bloody climax. I dont want to be accused of gushing praise, but there is much to compliment the whole team involved here, from the tones of the production design, beautifully capturing the mood feel and look of the 1970s in drab pastels and the grey of urban decay. The editing, directing, lighting is all bang on the money but greatest of all is the casting, for it is not only O Connell who shines here, but the younger members of the cast almost upstage him with their brilliant performances. Two stand outs of the younger cast were Corey Mc Kinley (Listed rather almost like an extra on here as Loyalist Child which seems a little unfair) and Barry Keoghan  The former is clearly a star in the making with his ballsy performance while Keoghan with almost no lines makes an amazing impact with simple looks conveying the struggles of emotion he feels inside when it comes to committing to a path of violence. Veterans Sean Harris brings his creepy presence to the duplicitous under cover unit commander but it is an energetic performance by O Connell that brings it all together. Let us hope we do not loose him to Hollywood entirely. The film also takes time to give Hooks character some context, so we have some idea of his own life and attachments back home. A man almost without a family but not without people who are depending on him, this is a true depicting for many whom join the army, an alternative to spending life on the dole. This film is living proof that we can make thrilling and exciting cinema in the UK but still leave some room for Social Commentary within the context of a great story  an excellent thriller which hints at the dark path that was to follow in Northern Ireland for many years. Strongly recommended.",True
"An unforgettable piece of total cinema First of all, I have to say that this film is one of my personal favorites, and that it is one of those things one must see during his or her lifetime.Truthfully, however, I first got into this film after hearing clips of the soundtrack on the Japanese version of Iron Chef, during a time before it was acquired by the Food Network. This film score, composed by the great postminimalist Michael Nyman, is still one of the most haunting and soulstirring scores in my opinion, if not the one of the most impressionable bodies of musical work ever. I still listen to the album on a weekly basis  it gets under your skin that way.The film itself is a piece of total art, as others have said. The sets are saturated with their singular color schemes (blue for the restaurants exterior, green for the kitchen, white for the restrooms, and red for the main dining hall) , and people who have any sort of artistic training have valued and will continue to value this film as a character study of color. In this present age where most films present their interpretations of visual thrill through costly CG and SFX technologies, this film is a testament to how color can be a driving influence behind effective set design and cinematography.The principal actors, including the always amazing Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon, are first rate. Helen Mirrens Georgina is a truly heartwrenching character, especially in the face of Gambons portrayal of Albert Spica, a poor excuse for a human being and one of cinemas cruelest villains. The cook and lover are merely catalysts, serving to instigate the final act that is the undoing of Alberts overreaching tyranny.I suppose the anti Thatcher sentiment is highly applicable to this film, but since I am not a British citizen, I feel that I cannot comment on this. However, I think the films allegory can also be applied to other scenarios where a brutish figure uses violence and exploitation as a way to control others whose primary fault is only residing in the same physical/social/legal domain as the brute.In short, a masterpiece.",True
"A Must See Thelma and Louise made a huge splash when it was released and has since become a part of the pop culture lexicon. In it, a mistreated housewife and harried waitress stumble into an outofcontrol  but totally liberating  crime spree. As bold and relevant as ever, it remains a vastly entertaining mustsee.Callie Khouris screenplay is a feeling, funny classic and director Ridley Scott lends this road movie epic scope, seeking out the beauty in open spaces.Both leads  Geena Davis as Thelma and Susan Sarandon as Louise  give fine performances. Thelma and Louise become fully realized human beings who share a powerful and authentic friendship. Their transformation into two outlaws is also made entirely believable by the actresses.And what about the men? Harvey Keitel is charming as the sympathetic lawman, Hal, and Michael Madsens turn as Louises boyfriend Jimmy is wonderfully nuanced. Brad Pitt also leaves a strong impression as the winsome blonde thief J.D. Its easy to see why this film made Pitt a star.Thelma and Louise is a film of rare cultural resonance, to be sure. Yet while undoubtedly provocative, this movie is also alot of fun.",False
"Blushy, Blushy ...Greetings again from the darkness. Much anticipated, twisted comedy from writer/director Richard Shepard is a coming out party for Pierce Brosnan the actor. That Bond guy is gone. This new guy is something else entirely!! Have read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble, Facilitator ... and is anything but pretty! Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one. If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex, killing, religion, sports, business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to behold.Greg Kinnear is the straight guy to Brosnans comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click. Hope Davis has a small, but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnears wife (whats with her name Bean?) who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room.The visuals and settings are perfect  including a bullfight, racetrack and Denver suburb. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This one is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky filmmaking, it could be for you.",False
"powerful performanceby the dialogue, you can tell this story began as a very good play. the issue with making a movie from a very good play is that you have to add something impossible to do on stage. i think paltrow does an excellent job. im not a big gwyn fan, but the way she portrayed her deep sadness throughout the movie, in closeups you wouldnt see from the balcony section of a theater  the fragility of her grasp on reality, the trauma of watching her father deteriorate before her eyes... this is something beyond a beautiful mind, which centered more on the hallucinations and surreality of a victim of mental disease. proof, instead, focuses on the fatherdaughter relationship and how, even after caring for his deteriorated mind for years, a daughter doesnt think twice about seeking her fathers approval  as if he could be coherent for the moment she needed him to be. i thought that was the most poignant part of the movie. theres not a lot to the story of the movie, but the depth in the performances  paltrow, hopkins and hope davis  is worth the ticket. its nice to actually see a very good movie once in a while.",False
"What movies are supposed to be Pay It Forward is a prime example of what films are supposed to do:  make you laugh a little, cry a lot, and profoundly affect you in a way that keeps you thinking about the movie for weeks afterwards.  I saw it at a special preview screening and was blown away.  My friends and I sat through the entire credits because we were so taken by what we had seen.  Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and the phenomonal Haley Joel Osment once again give performances worthy of Oscars.  I only hope there isnt some retaliation of sorts because of their previous wins and nominations because they deserve it again this year.  But the big winner here is director Mimi Leder who has moved from action films into great cinema.  She demonstrates the fine tuned skills she showed while directing ER.  As I sat there, one eye kept a close watch of the story while the other marveled at the beautiful direction of every scene.  They have my vote for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actress, and Screenplay.  Aweinspiring!!!!",True
"A New Side of Sandler Adam Sandler is known for his wacky, flaky, and sometimes over the top style of comedy. With films like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy under his belt, one would think that he would stick with what hes got. Sandler has shown us a new side of him with his performance in Paul Thomas Andersons Punch Drunk Love.Sandler plays Barry Egan, an ambitious man who owns and operates his own business. He sells his own plungers. One day after finishing a phone call with a food company, he walks outside to find a tiny piano someone dropped on the side of the road. He runs after it and puts it in his office. Then shortly after he meets Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) who needs help with her car. Being the nice guy he is, he complies.Barry Egan is a great guy. He is nice and is trying his best to do well. With seven sisters, he faces the brunt of their vicious wrath that they unintentionally place upon him. With embarrassing stories of growing up and how they teased him, Barry has a little built up anger that he uses here and there, like his sisters sliding glass door. Barry means well, but man can he do damage.When lonely one night, Barry calls a sex line for just someone to talk to. What he ends up getting himself into is a huge scandal with the operator of the sex line due to the fact that he gave his credit card number to them and everything they need to know to get money from him. On top of this, Barry has found a way to cheat the food company he talks to in the beginning. The deal is getting free frequentflyer miles due to a deal the company has on all of their items...including individual pudding cups. Barry pounces on the opportunity by buying as many 25 cent cups as he can so he can fly anywhere for free.With an interesting plot and a great performance by both Sandler and Watson, this film is bound to make an impact. Sandlers more dramatic side shows, giving us a glimpse at the real actor behind all of the goofy nonsense we have come to love over the years. It was really refreshing to see a comedian do a really good job acting in a serious role. It reminded me of Jim Carey is The Truman Show. Serious, yet still able to crack a joke, much like Sandler in this film.Anderson is no newcomer when it comes to movies. He has written and directed a couple of gems. Boogie Nights and Magnolia are two he both wrote and directed and came out great. This movie is no different. Its unique style with interesting choices for music give the picture an edge.If Sandler keeps landing roles like this, he could potentially put himself in position for an Oscar nomination, much like Bill Murray did with Lost in Translation. Thats not to say he shouldnt make his regular comedies, but a nice blend would be great. Punch Drunk Love is a knockout!",False
"A dreamlike examination of love and first contact Two truths drive this film: the inadequacy of humankind to understand the Universe, and the inadequacy of humankind to understand the human heart.As such, using Lems original idea, Tarkovsky successfully, explores these themes.We are drawn in, through hauntingly beautiful imagery, to the internal struggles of Kris Kelvin as he attempts to understand feelings of love for his suicided wife, who has been mysteriously resurrected, presumably as an attempt by Solaris to communicate, or torture.Of course Solaris is probably the most original alien ever concocted, (no phonehomes here) and as must be, utterly enigmatic and beyond communication.Be warned, this film is very long, and sometimes slow, but for those who consider themselves science fiction addicts, it is a must view.One of the top 5 scifi films of all time.",True
"An excellent movie I was lucky to see this movie in Paris where this movie was firstreleased in the cinemas. I was really impressed by the brilliantperformances of Andy Garcia and Elsa Zylberstein and the rest of the cast. Andy Garcia is a VERY versatile and extremely talented actor. We may already know this story is about the last years of life of the Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani and set in Paris in 1919. However this movie has a new approach and new ideas and it is not an ordinary biography movie. The spirit of Paris in that period comes alive in this movie. Everyone who involved in this movie worked with passion and passion is actually a main theme of this movie.I totally enjoyed seeing this movie and I hope that this movie will be released widely and many people will be able to see it. We are all surrounded by those big blockbuster movies nowadays and it is so nice to see Modigliani, a real gem.",False
"More Silly and Stupid than Funny In Atlanta, the uptight architect Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is ready to go to the airport to fly in the firstclass to meet his wife that has a Caesarean section scheduled in Los Angeles for the birth of their first son in five days. However, he stumbles with the clumsy pothead and aspirant actor Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) that provokes an incident in the cabin and they are expelled from the plane and Peter is included in the nofly list.

Peter is forced to accept the lift of Ethan that has attended the funeral service of his father and intend to drop his ashes in the Grand Canyon. Peter has a painful journey with many incidents and accidents and changes his behavior. Due Date is a disappointing and uneven comedy that is more silly and stupid than funny. The plot uses a similar storyline of Dinner for the Schmucks with a straight man that meets a schmuck and is forced to stay with him to achieve a goal. I had great expectation that Due Date would be a great film, but the situations that are supposed to be funny never work and I laughed only in a couple of scenes. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): Um Parto de Viagem (A Delivery Trip)",False
"Best film of the year What can I say that previous fans of this movie have not said yet?  I think that Mike Leigh is the best filmmaker working today.  So, I wont bother rehashing the story line.I am convinced even thinking back to 1991, when it was released in the US, that Life is Sweet was the best of that year.  That year was remembered more for, among others, Schindlers List, The Remains of the Day and The Piano.
Alison Steadman seemingly insensitive lighthearted outlook on the world laughing after nearly every sentence she or others utter, which incredibly I never tired of (an amazing feat), is all just her way of dealing with life.  She sees it for what it is.  The scene where she explains to her daughter Nicola how much of a sacrifice that she and her husband have made for the sake of their family is one of the most touching I have seen between a mother and daughter.  I felt as though I was eavesdropping while watching it.  What a pleasure!",True

"Best Shrek Forever Best Shrek. It is a special movie, one of the best movies of alltime. It is a masterpiece on par with the mona lisa. What is so masterful about Shrek is its ambiguity. We never are certain if Shrek really did believe in the values that he professed. At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people. This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Fiona. Her character is given a paperthin characterization, the closest thing to a flaw in a perfect movie. Despite the films pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells Mercury Theater are also superb. So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of its characters is universal in its compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art. Its influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearsts efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Shrek 4ever after. Its not just a masterpiece its a creative touchstone.",False
"It is about compassion, trust, and wisdom Chiron, in Barry Jenkins Oscarwinning film Moonlight, in addition to being gay and black, has to deal with drug abuse, bullying, and the lack of a supportive home environment. In contrast, in Luca Guadagninos (A Bigger Splash) achingly beautiful Call Me by Your Name, 17yearold Elios (Timothée Chalamet, Love the Coopers) life is safe, comfortable, and surrounded by love though, like Chiron, he must come to terms with his true identity. Written by threetime Oscar nominee James Ivory and adapted from the 2007 novel by Andre Aciman, Call Me by Your Name is set in the summer of 1983 where Oliver (Armie Hammer, Free Fire) is an American research assistant studying with art history Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg, Steve Jobs) at Perlmans gorgeous villa in Northern Italy.Oliver arrives at this idyllic setting with its gardens, peach trees, and lakes to greet the professor, his wife Annella (Amira Casar, Planetarium) a lover of German poetry, and his teenage son Elio who speaks several languages and transcribes piano scores for the guitar. Shot by Thai cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom (Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives) and buoyed by new songs from Sufjan Stevens, it is easy to feel yourself present in the languid summer afternoon, as Aciman expresses it, with the scent of rosemary, the heat, the birds, the cicadas, the sway of palm fronds, the silence that falls like a light linen shawl on an appallingly sunny day. With Olivers arrival, Elio now has to shift his focus from pursuing his French girlfriend Marzia (Esther Garrel, Daydreams) to show the American student around town and give him bike tours of the area. Soon, however, he becomes annoyed by the Americans brusque manner and his abrupt later whenever hes leaving. When Elio, who is Jewish, sees Oliver wearing a Star of David on a chain around his neck, however, he finds a common bond, jokingly telling him that his mother considers their family to be Jews in discretion. Sharing the same bathroom, their friendship begins to expand when they engage in conversation and go swimming together. Although Oliver gives Elio a neck massage during a volley ball game, the boy seems unable or unwilling to process the feelings that it brings up in him.When Oliver causally tells Elio that he seems to know everything, the teenager confesses that he knows everything except what really matters. Even when physical intimacy is established, there is the sense that they hold back from fully expressing their feelings and even prefer not to talk about them. Chalamet, in his first leading role, is a revelation, delivering a deeply affecting performance that shows great promise. Hammers performance is restrained, but also fully believable, making sure that the age difference does not get in the way of the honest and genuine relationship they have established. As they strengthen their friendship, like lovers, their identities blend into each other and they express it verbally by taking each others name. Call Me by Your Name is not an us versus them movie. There are no antagonists in the film. It is a celebration of love in all its wonder and mystery.There is gay sex in the movie but, like Moonlight, it is about more than sex. As Guadagnino says, it is about compassion, trust, and wisdom. All three of these values are expressed in the conversation between Elio and his dad, an interchange that is moving and wise. Though the film is gaythemed, Guadagnino does not pigeonhole the characters into familiar categories and his refusal to deal in stereotypes or manufactured emotion gives the film the space to breathe and reach the place where tension can grow. Like Moonlight, Call Me by Your Name has a universal appeal and can touch anyone, gay or straight, who has ever felt the confused and conflicting longings of first love, or who knows from experience that, in the words of the song Plaisir damour, The joy of love is but a moment long. The pain of love endures the whole life long.",True
"A shining occasion for modern cinema, Happy Go Lucky welcomely explores a range of emotions and themes.On first impression, Mike Leighs new film feels like a lighthearted, simpleminded and a briefly delightful flick. But when it comes to Leigh; you should enter with the assumption that you will leave drained from all other thoughts. Happy Go Lucky is no different. However, it has certainly got a balanced amount of comedic and dramatic elements, each outweighing each other once present on screen. The naturalistic and fast paced dialogue intertwined with slang and theory, with wit and sarcasm is contained for an intense, joyful and powerful viewing. Harsh and realistic danger is presented for emotional enhancement rather than the exaggerated situations in the conventional Hollywood film. We are set with a protagonist and remain with her to the end plus the pleasant charm of the British culture entwined.Sally Hawkins shines as the lead, Poppy, in one of the best performances of the year, a seemingly naive extrovert with a very expressive and optimistic attitude towards life and all her hardships. She laughs at unfortunate events that she suffers, such as getting her bicycle  her form of personal transport, of which she enjoys to wave at people whilst riding  stolen, as if it were a cruel irony and she gets the joke. This upbeat spirit is rarely broken, even if the polar opposite of attitudes comes into contact with her unless taken to the absolute limit. She is an inviting figure, one that which desires to inspire her mood and thoughts on life. In doing so, she becomes a primary teacher, when the mind is at its spongiest. There is a scene where she experiments creativity with her long term roommate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman) in the form of cardboard boxes and more materials to make a birdlike costume. Poppy is the definitive authority figure in the film. To match her personality is the excessive clothes with often delicate unnecessary items just to provide bright colours in the darkest of hues in the scenes. This brightness transcends her performance and makes her my absolute favourite leading performance of the year.The most expressive supporting performance comes from Eddie Marsan, as Scott, Poppys driving instructor. However, his character is the opposite to Poppys, always agitated and enraged when flaws occur. His character does not mix with her at all. The driving scenes are the utmost emotionally engaging scenes in the entire film and form the structure of routine giving a basis and understanding of the time frame therefore the development the characters go about in their relationships with each other  especially since they meet during his last shift so he wants to escape the working mode and enter the more relaxing mode of no responsibility. Scott constantly misinterprets Poppys actions, as if shes sexually teasing him for her pleasure or patronizing his behaviour. During their rather short journeys of stopping, starting, arguing, repeating explanations  the tension really builds up. Every time Scotts rage is starting to show Poppy strikes him down with a joke to calm him; or maybe herself. Happy Go Lucky had the power to make a grin evolve across my face then wipe it straight off again within the same shot. Her comfort is very limited and only appears again with the most prominent support of Zoe (a wonderfully sarcastic performance which is an absolute joy to see every time)  even more so than her family that do appear not necessarily in an agreeable situation. There is also a rather striking and bleak scene in which Poppy encounters a tramp (played by Stanley Townsend) where he confronts her in a strange gibberish without a seeming understanding of his correct surroundings. This hobo is a symbolism of freedom, of complete and utter creativity with his language and imagination. When Poppy is presented with this person she is in a state of confusion as what to do.This is the whole point of the film. Authority (Poppy), with its intimidating and overbearing behaviour, overtakes that of the weaker society (the children), so fills their views when theyll most likely take it in without hassle and live by these thoughts. Despite allowing the children to express themselves through the medium of products she is still controlling them and not allowing complete freedom; yes, on the outside they may all be different, but technically they are all birdcostumes  therefore she is not able to properly inspire the creativity she wishes to do so. However, once presented with a form of society that has matured and developed their own opinions and morals it is more difficult to get through to them  hence the firmer attitude Poppy has to resort to in order to get Scott (this figure of society) to conform. The flaws become more prominent once authority is unable to abide by their own rules to make society work; which is shown during the dance classes as she is clearly out of time with everyone and making up her own moves. Or a simpler interpretation and a completely valid one, is that Poppy is a child at heart, therefore her desire to work with children and therefore her dependence on the older flatmate and the fact she prefers to use a nickname as apposed to her real name (Pauline). Or possibly willfully ignorant.Other than Sally Hawkins incredible performance, Happy Go Luckys strength comes from the balanced script, cinematography and editing, with the ability to achieve a range of tones therefore reactions from the viewer. Natural and sharp dialogue makes for always compelling and entertaining viewing. The colour is pure eye candy, with bright bold shapes and no hues between the colours giving the film personality within itself  without the help of Sally Hawkins. The score adds to the delight with a bubbly mix of string and jazz, reflecting the main characters. Although I completely understand how someone can find these irritable, I, however, find them an absolute joy; never wanting the intense, rewarding, enriching and enlightening experience to end.9/10",False

"BUFFALO 66 is Great.Considering that Vincent Gallo made a film that i pretty much hated, THE BROWN BUNNY, Its reassuring that he still has made this great film. I really had a ball watching this one. From the opening sequence of him leaving jail to the heartwarming, yet chilling ending scene, this is a film with lots of great moments. A man has just gotten out of jail and is to visit his parents, but first he needs a girlfriend and decides to kidnap a ballet dancer and force her to role play as his girlfriend. But when she starts to get too into the idea, the man shows his limits in a series of comic events ranging from darkly funny, to very inspired. And yet in between these events are moments of extremely depressing and moody sort of moments that elevate the film into a truly original masterpiece. A little bit brutal, a little bit surreal, and very depressing, the film manages to strike a perfect balance of comedy and drama and incorporate them into a truly original independent classic. Its definitely not for everyone, as a lot of the films i comment on are, but the audience that it is made for will fall in love with BUFFALO 66.",False
"An homage to old age and the meaning of life, if there is one A loving homage to an actor and musician that anyone over 50 has seen in movies over several decades. I wiped away tears several times over beautiful, thoughtful musings by Lucky, who, in most respects, was Harry Dean Stanton himself. This is a small but significant slice of life movie and showcases excellent writing, direction and acting by several collaborators whove worked together before. Notable understated performance by David Lynch whose characters lost tortoise serves as an analogy that some viewers who havent lived several decades yet will not yet appreciate. I was stilled when Lucky sang, sad when Johnny Cash sang and I smiled, satisfied, at the end. I will watch this movie again with friends who understand the beauty of a simple and well written film like this and we will all feel satisfied and more connected as a result.",True
"Not As Good as Original, But Still A Good, Dark Tale I erred in giving into temptation to watch the original Norwegian Insomnia on IFC just a couple of weeks before seeing this Hollywood remake directed by indiecredible Memento Christopher Nolan with a very effective Academy Awardwinning cast.The original movie had a tiny budget and also an excellent cast, led by the terrific Swede Stellan Skarsgård, growing as pale as that relentless sunshine during the course of the film; the usually haggardlooking Al Pacino interprets his insomnia visually through an ever more haggard face.Though the original film isnt given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely. The changes, though, are both subtle and significant and intriguingly as American as Sam Spade when the mise en scene gets moved to Alaska (actually shot in Vancouver). Significantly, there is less sex and more morality.Hilary Swanks character is more naive than her counterpart; Martin Donovans characters role is more central to the story and, of course, Robin Williams gets more screen time than his original counterpart, as the conflict is less in the leads mind and more on the screen as a duel. The plot twists are done differently so I shamefully got confused between the two movies.While not as overwhelming as the original, I do think this version should rank right up with the great detective/copdoestherightthing movies, and the plot makes more sense than The Big Sleep.(originally written 6/16/2002)",True
"Hurricane Cate.....Loved the script, loved the cast, loved all the performances, but dear God, Cate Blanchett was so incredible I couldnt catch a breath. What a performance! So many emotions at the same time, so multilayered, subtle and yet unbearable.... She takes a character one normally wouldnt really care about where she ends up to someone, who despite her tragic and repeated mistakes and the fact that she made her own bed, you send up caring about, you end up understanding her. Blanchett took a huge risk with that emotionally exposing role and proved herself to be master and commander. If any other actress had played that role, it wouldnt even be half as good. Her theatrical background and experience is all concentrated in in Jasmine. Heartwrenching, powerful and utterly vulnerable at the same time, cruel but simultaneously caring in her very own way... Its the performance of the decade for me and one of the best of all times, a true masterclass.And as Letterman told Blanchett when she was a guest at his show (not really a fan of his but what he said was totally true), even if he had directed the film instead of Allen, the result would still have been a masterpiece because of Cate.",True
"Poignant mystery thriller known for its bad cop plus bad cop pairing Rating: 8 out of 10. Written and Directed by Joe Carnahan.Narc is one of the best movies that I have seen in recent months, I rented it several weeks ago from the video store and caught most of it again just last week on a movie channel. This is a story of bad cop and bad cop working together, which is a relief to me since the good cop plus bad cop pairing is too over done. Joe Carnahan shows that he is an extremely talented writer and director. I have found myself thinking back to this movie several times since seeing it. It has a unique quality and excellent style to it. It also does not hurt to have good writing and directing that was complimented with the great acting of Jason Patric and Ray Liotta. Jason Patric is Nick Tellis, an undercover narcotics officer. The movie opens with Tellis chasing a drug dealer through backyards and into a park until the chase ends with a shooting, the suspect gets hit, but so does a pregnant woman that was a bystander. The next scene takes place over a year later, and Tellis is in a boardroom meeting with a police board of inquiry. We find out that the pregnant woman that got shot lost her unborn child and that Tellis has been on an administrative leave all this time for over a year. The board offers him a deal, which is to solve the murder of a slain undercover narcotics officer named Michael Calvess. If he solves this murder, he will be fully reinstated with a choice assignment. Tellis storms out of the meeting declining the offer. A police captain played by Chi Mc Bride follows Tellis out the room and is able to convince Tellis to reconsider. As Tellis starts to investigate the murder, he requests the help of Calvess former partner Henry Oak played by Ray Liotta. Initially the police captain says that Oak is off limits to the Calvess case and mentions that Oak is unstable. Oak isnt just unstable, he is a brutal cop, and we see a few flashback scenes of Oak viciously beating up suspects. Police Internal Affairs is always on the look out to find Oak guilty of brutality or planting evidence or any of the violations of conduct that Oak is suspected of doing. What allows Oak to continue to roam around like a vigilante is his impressive work record, the majority of Oaks arrests end up with a conviction. Therefore, Tellis is able to get Oak back onto the case.
As we see Tellis and Oak investigate, we see some very unusual characters and a couple of twists to the storyline. Of course Oak is quite brutal and Tellis is okay with using police brutality at times but is sometimes surprised at Oaks actions and methods. The movie ends with some shocking revelations. Narc was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002. Which is not a surprise since this was a very good film.",False
"Superb Acting and a Gem of a Film Ed Harris, Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Paul Bettany were terrific.The film had great balance and is worth a viewing.The story boldly addresses mental illness as a handicap.Because of the quality of the acting and directing, this movie is a beacon of hope for people of all disabilities. The film illustrates to the viewer how deeply a handicap can infiltrate the domestic, professional, and personal lives of those unfortunate to have these types of issues. I hope Ron Howard and the acting crew can get together again for something similar. This was a great film, that also serves an important role for awareness to people that might not understand how deeply debilitating these issues can be, and also gets the message across that not all should be marginalized.",True
"Beautiful Film I was initially dubious about going to see this film after I read a lot of mixed reviews. However, I am glad that I decided to just bite the bullet and go see it. This is one of the most visually stunning and entrancing films I have ever seen, with a wonderful storyline which had me clutching the edge of my seat in sheer frustration! I absolutely loved the love story that was central to the film, although I was a bit worried by the age gap. lol. It made me really want a snow cone though. I thought Zhang Ziyi was fantastic in the part of Sayuri, and she made the character very endearing and real. I am a big fan of Ken Watanabe, and it was good to see him in a part like this; the relationship was very believable and I thought they were both great. In fact, all the actors in this film did their characters justice and helped to make the film as beautiful and Oscarworthy as it is. I just loved the story and all the sets that provided a wonderful backdrop for such an emotional, powerful tale. I recommend this to everyone! Its THAT good!",True
"From documentary to film Well, you cant go wrong using Big and Little Edie as subject matter, be it in a documentary, a movie, or a musical. This beautifully photographed and opulent Grey Gardens, starring Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore as Big and Little Edie, again demonstrates what compelling people they were.Not having seen any documentary yet, or the musical, which had some powerful emotions expressed in the music (Another Winter in a Summer Town as an example), I can only go by this particular Grey Gardens. The story of the Beales is sad, harrowing, frustrating, and sometimes funny. Both women are magnificent in their roles, particularly Lange, though my understanding is that the real Big Edie was a much better singer than shown here. Barrymore makes a stunning young Edie, living in New York and trying to make it as an actress and captures the mature woman  its quite a stretch, too.Whats missing here is exactly what happened to these two beautiful and wealthy women, and Im not sure its covered in any other material about them. Why didnt Big Edie remarry? Why didnt Edie The Body Beautiful Beale get a rich husband? Why did the other children allow them to live the way they did? Was Little Edie untalented, or could she have had success as an actress? Were they always mentally unstable or eccentric or make each other that way? I dont know after watching Grey Gardens, though Im sure Lange and Barrymore made some decisions about those things in order to play their roles.The nice thing about Grey Gardens, for me, anyway, is that Little Edie finally got what she wanted in life  fame (well, notoriety), the ability to perform, money, and a warm place to live. Im happy about that for her. I just wish I knew more about the psychology that led up to all of it.",True
"Soderberghs best film is a thrilling ride...The film more than delivers on every level and is certainly a lock for Best Picture of the year. Soderbergh has been on an astonishing roll, demonstrating exceptional versatility in his choice of genres and tremendous agility in balancing artistry with entertainment. Hes been Americas most consistently brilliant and unpredictable filmmaker for the last decade, and Traffic is the culminating work of his career. First and foremost, its a richly entertaining epic that recalls the great works of the 1970s, when directors like Robert Altman and Francis Ford Coppola engaged mass audiences with works of genuine substance. Soderbergh works on a larger canvass than hes ever done before, bouncing several characters and plotlines against and off each other, so that images and themes rhyme and echo. Although the subject matter is drug trafficking, this is not an issues movie per se. Instead, its a profoundly affecting dramatic thriller where the destructive forces of drugs cut across different sections of society. Whats most impressive about the direction is how Soderbergh manages to avoid both sentimentalizing and moralizing about drugs. As with Erin Brockovich, theres a graceful absence of selfimportance and bombast in the presentation. However, this doesnt mean the film lacks a strong point of view.Stylistically, this film represents a major breakthrough. Soderbergh shot the film himself (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) and Traffic takes all of his past experiments with color, available light, and handheld work lightyears beyond The Limey and Out of Sight. He has created a brilliant style that could best characterized as expressionistic naturalism. His loose handheld style lends the film an extremely spontaneous realistic tone, but the modifications of color amplify the drama. Each storyline has its own distinct look that accentuates the emotions underlining the film. (The Mexico story involving Benicio Del Toro is told in earthy saturated yellows, the story of Michael Douglas and his daughter Erika Christensen is told in an aquarium blue, while the Catherine Zeta Jones, Luis Guzman Don Cheadle story gets a natural available light look). In addition to being visually striking and cool in a completely unpretentious manner, Soderberghs camera technique transcends mere virtuosity and actually becomes another character in the film. As usual with Soderbergh, the film is edited with musical verve and skill, where time is collapsed and expanded, and characters are seen reflecting on past actions.Ive been remiss in not discussing the acting earlier. This film has an amazing ensemble cast where everybody is working at the top of their game. However, Benicio Del Toro definitely stands out with the breakthrough performance. I dont think its accidental that the movie begins and ends with shots of him. He plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer caught in a futile and corrupt system, and its as compelling of a character as Michael Corleone. Del Toro is exceptionally relaxed and subtle, keeping his thoughts and feelings private from the other characters in the films, but sharing it with the camera. Del Toro navigates the audience through a world of impossible choices and moral corruption, quietly simmering with intense conflict just beneath the surface.  Benicios been an indie stalwart for years, but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. If theres justice in this world, hell be rewarded with Best Actor Awards aplenty.Michael Douglas is also terrific, adding another strong performance to his gallery of flawed men in power. He shows genuine fear and vulnerability in a harrowing scene in which he searches for his daughter in a drug dealers den. Ive never seen Erika Christensen before, but she makes an impressive debut.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman (they should star as a team in every movie!) are as loose, limber and spontaneous as ever, providing plenty of comic relief as well as keeping it real. Catherine Zeta Jones takes a complete 180 from her past roles and admirably plays against her looks, appearing very pregnant while thrown into gritty surroundings. Dennis Quaid is appropriately slimy as a corrupt lawyer.Anyway, film geeks and anybody else starved for a genuine piece of filmmaking should breathe a sigh of relief and give thanks that Soderbergh has come to save the day.",False
"The best of the Dirtiest DIRTY HARRY (1971) **** Clint Eastwood, Harry Guardino, Andy Robinson, John Vernon.  Eastwood made cinematic lore out of laconic San Francisco renegade cop Harry Callahan known more for his intolerence of the bureaucratic legal system and his firm belief in justice through violent means necessitated by righting wrongs.  In the first of the series hes faced with a psycho serial killer named Scorpio (grinning looney toon Robinson) just begging to be noticed.  Directed by Eastwoods longtime mentor Don Siegal the film acts as a parable of the system strangleholding society and still remains an indictment of how bad things still are.  Classic Clint.",False
"Profound, poignant and hilarious with a commendably askew approach – an ideal character study It is fascinating to see certain movies that achieve a specific balance between the familiar and the unique, a particular dynamic perfectly representative of writer/director/actor Tim Blake Nelsons Leaves of Grass. On the surface, the films prevailing themes of family, reconciliation with ones roots and the tensions between educated/upper class and working/lower class are identifiable as those articulated in countless films and other cultural texts, suggesting just one more retread of the same material. At the same time, in an elusive sense, the particular angle the material is addressed feels somehow fresh and unique, making Leaves of Grass particularly vibrant, dynamic and compelling, both as a narrative and individual character study. In its most distilled essence, the film charts a rampantly successful Ivy League philosophy professor (Norton) forced to return to and come to terms with his less than glamorous family ties in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Of course the narrative covers significantly more ground than that, particularly the professor being sucked into an illadvised and hardly legal scheme by his madcap, drug dealer twin brother (also Norton), but Nelson returns so continuously to the aforementioned central themes that the increasingly complex plot surrounding them runs the risk of feeling somewhat besides the point, as enjoyable as it is. However, it is through evolving such a complex web of narrative that Nelsons film feels all the more unique, allowing him to tackle often covered themes with not only a more fresh and indirect approach, but also a great deal more authenticity. Each of the films characters, as colourful and occasionally larger than life as they may be, feels strikingly real, making their actions and interactions within such a convoluted story alternatively more resonant and hilarious, as if each are playing the straight man against an increasingly madcap story unfolding around them. With the same charming, powerful yet slightly kooky tone which pervades many of his acting performances, Nelson sets up his film in a wonderfully askew fashion, taking delight in veering right when the logical narrative progression would suggest left, and offering a fair share of surprise twists, including several jarring or downright uncomfortable bursts of serious intensity discordantly changing altering the generally breezy mood. However thematically familiar, the framework of Nelsons film does feel refreshingly unexpected, even if it does somewhat lose its momentum towards the end, trundling towards a denouement that feels somewhat underthought or vaguely less than effective. Nonetheless, a lively musical score and crisp editing propel the film along at a generally steady pace, assuring that despite the rare stumbling, Nelsons film feels fundamentally alive, truthful and riotously enjoyable. But, as is common with such characterfocused material, it is the cast that ultimately drives the story home. Nelson himself has admitted that he wrote the lead twin characters for Edward Norton, and it is impossible to imagine any other performer offering two such superbly nuanced, powerful and entertaining, not to mention fundamentally different characterizations within a single film, managing the rarely seen trick of playing off himself to perfection. Norton infuses so much life, passion and charisma of such varied sorts into both roles that it is easy to forget they are played by the same actor  a masterclass of acting propelling the emotional centre of the film, and almost singlehandedly making it merit viewing. Keri Russell is similarly fantastic, channeling her trademark sweet, down to earth charm into her performance as a reflective poet and teacher – her riverside philosophical musings make for some of the most quietly thoughtprovoking and enjoyable cinematic asides of quite some time. Tim Blake Nelson himself manages several laughs and sturdy emotional support as a stoic fellow marijuana grower, and Susan Sarandon offers raw and frequently hilarious emotional vulnerability as both Nortons exhippie mother, forced to reflect on a life of questionable choices. Finally, in a tragically but necessarily brief role, Richard Dreyfuss is hilarious as a respectable Tulsa philanthropist with several shady ties to the less respectable underbelly of the community, making his few scenes shine with shrewd hilarity. Wacky yet poignantly credible, Nelsons film hits its stride through its melding of familiar content with unfamiliar approach, propelled by a careful, clever script and tremendously memorable characters. In an age filled with ambitious studio films making hefty grabs at easy emotion, it is a delight to witness cinema that manages something powerful, profound and incredibly enjoyable without obvious, clichéd emotional hooks of any sort, making Leaves of Grass without question worth a watch. 8/10",False
"Acting is superb While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made will ever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie is very well done. I read many reviews going either way, but I must say I enjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Macs performance saying he didnt do a good job. I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.If you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.One warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austens satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that. But overall I thought it was a great film.",False
"A Powerful Triangle of Love in the Beginning of the American Intervention in Vietnam In Saigon, 1951, Thomas Fowler (Michael Fowler) is an English journalist, married in England with a catholic woman, and in love with a Vietnamese girl, Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). Thomas meets Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) in a bar. Pyle is a doctor working in an aid mission, and pretty soon, he falls in love with Phuong. Pyle offers her what Thomas is not possible to give, i.e., a marriage and escape of Vietnam. Meanwhile, the political situation in Vietnam is boiling, with the French trying to get control again of the country, the communists trying to impose their system to the South, and the American secretly giving support to a third Vietnamese part. This romance is perfect: the outstanding performance of Michael Caine in the first plane, and Brendan Fraser (in his best role, since Gods and Monsters) and Do Thi Hai Yen are fantastic. The screenplay of Christopher Hampton, based in a novel of Graham Greene, is wonderful. And the direction of Phillip Noyce is magnificent, presenting the story in right doses of romance, drama, action and special effects. An overwhelming movie for all tastes.

"The poetry of deceit and loneliness This film must be watched very carefully. If youre not paying enough attention to it, you would miss it (some did). Its in the frames, the atmosphere, the tiny details, the situations, the acting, everything. But its not that obvious, unless you enter that world. Simple story? Sure. Life is simple. So is great art. All in all, About Schmidt is a really great film. Bitter humor, allpervading lie, the infinite sadness of loneliness and failure, sincere egoism, everyday dullness, desperate and quiet hope  this is life, and in a nonblatant, nor melodramatic manner.

"A 90s classic!Although not nearly as popular as it deserves to be, GROSS POINTE BLANK has become an increasingly respected cult flick in the year following its theatrical release and its not hard to see why. The movie is probably the only film on earth that is able to blend comedy, graphic violence, and romance together perfectly, which is what makes it such a classic. John Cusack is excellent as Martin Q. Blank, a hitman who attends his tenyear high school reunion. At first he doesnt want to, but decides to go since he has a case there and he wants to see his old girlfriend Debbie (Minnie Driver) again. This dark comedy is heavy on exciting action, suspense, gunfire, laughs, and fun, but it doesnt have not quite enough character development for my taste (a bit more on how Martin became accustomed to killing would have been nice). Still, GROSSE POINTE BLANK was one of the best films of 1997 and one of the better comedies of the 1990s. There were rumors of a sequel happening for a while, though the chances of that happening are slim to none. Too bad.",False
"From Tinkering with Tools to Tinkering with People Primer starts out innocently like a Startup.com docudrama and the first part covers some of those same financial, friendship and entrepreneurial issues as computer geek engineers work out of of one of the partners garage to perfect an invention. But gradually, in this antiseptic atmosphere of white shirts, electrical experiments and tweaking mechanics, every human emotion, virtually as every seven deadly sin, except sloth, and beyond, starting with greed, takes them over. Without any explanation to the audience, we gradually figure out that were seeing a cleverer, low budget Paycheck or what Ground Hog Day played for laughs and an original Outer Limits episode did for irony (I didnt see The Butterfly Effect to see how it also dealt with time changes). Rather this is an attempt to seriously examine the philosophical issues of chaos theory and how inventions cant be divorced from human frailties, both mental and physical. Shane Carruth, as the lead actor/writer/director/producer is a true auteurand could therefore give his nerd a wife and kid but perhaps an outside editor could have helped make the permutations a bit clearer as I didnt quite follow the intersections with outside characters.

"Literary autobiography with heartfelt humor; Daniels career best and Oscar worthy THE SQUID AND THE WHALE (2005) **** Jeff Daniels, Laura Linney, Jessie Eisenberg, Owen Kline, Anna Paquin, William Baldwin. Literary autobiography with heartfelt humor.Filmmaker Noah Baumbach is back in fine form since his debut with the excellent Kicking and Screaming (a personal fave of mine; a Diner for the 90s) in this semiautobiographical account of his familys dealing with his parents divorce with bittersweet frankness and a heaping of witty humor.The family Berkman of Park Slope, Brooklyn circa the early 1980s, consists of author/teacher Bernard (Daniels in a career high performance that deserves an Oscar nod), literary pursuant mother Joan (Linney sublimely good) and sons Walt and Frank (Eisenberg and Kline, the latter the progeny of Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates making a Culkinian debut with surprising chops) aka Chicken and Pickle (their moms nicknames). The quartet is harmonious in literary pursuits and drastic life changes when the parents agree on separating sending the boys (and ultimately themselves) into an emotional tailspin.Bernard, a very sardonic critical yet loving man, is taking it very internally despite his sarcastic remarks about everything to his sons as a sounding board in his attempt to keep his boys together by a joint custody agreement with Joan by taking a fixerupper brownstone across the park while he deals with the likelihood that his new book will never be published. Joans affairs are discovered shockingly by the boys  Walt the more avuncularly bitter lashing out and blaming her for not giving the marriage a chance reasoning that dads lack of success has made her seek another shot a life of empty sex yet promise in her undiscovered writing talents (much to the resentment of Bernard); meanwhile budding tennis pro wannabe Frank, the youngest, begins to experiment with alcohol and masturbation.Added to the mix is Lili (Paquin), a female writing student of Bernards, who has a hidden agenda when Bernard invites her to share his new home as a roommate while the boys visit every other day with mixed results. Walt is attempting to begin a sexual awakening as well with his first girlfriend but is getting all the wrong comic advice from Bernard who is clueless with the opposite sex as he is also trying to have sex with Lili while burning over Joan who has hooked up with Franks tennis instructor Ivan (a doofy Baldwin whose every other utterance is Brother).Achingly funny, sharply witty and skewering with some pricelessly amusing moments including the running gag of Bernard driving his kids around the neighborhood (my space is missing! an apt metaphor for his listless situation) and subtle touches (Bernard reading Saul Bellows THE VICTIM and the new home decorated with posters of films like PSYCHO and THE MOTHER AND THE WHORE and using the instrumental theme of Tangerine Dreams score to Risky Business during Franks sexual awakenings!) ) bring a smile if not a burst of laughter in the unease of a familys reluctant transition that will scar them forever.Baumbach is clearly making a heartfelt valentine to his own upbringing when his parents eventually divorced during his trying teens and the affects that have rubbed off are bittersweet and universally humorous. He has a keen touch with his actors  especially Daniels, the centerpiece character, who is brilliantly funny, touching and headshaking misanthropic at the absurdity of his situation (at one point he says glibly with a touch of melancholy, thats my home which I used to live inas you may know, to his son during one of their jaunts back and forth) that has echoes of his first fine role as Flap, the philandering English professor husband of the doomed Debra Winger in Terms of Endearment, suggesting a bookend to what Flap may have become ultimately (and Im damned if Im not right at one point Walt is looking at his fathers novels backflap and the photo suggests a still from that film!). Bernard genuinely cares for his family but does things in such an assbackward (and frugal) way that it is borderline heartbreaking especially his confounded loss of his status (both professionally and familially) that at one point I welled up with tears as he caressed a shelve of books while dropping Frank off with his mom. Daniels has always been one of my alltime faves and a severely underrated (and underestimated actor) its be criminal if he didnt get an Academy Award nomination.There are some very funny moments throughout with the brothers particularly Franks stream of profanities in frustration at the tennis lessons (no doubt from his competitive father in several sequences) and Walts stonecold declaration that the musical piece he will be performing, Pink Floyds Hey You, was written by him as an original work! Baumbach has crafted some fine work over the years (the aforementioned masterpiece of Kicking & Screaming about recent college grad buds deliberately not accepting their new status in the real world by refusing to adapt and his recent collaboration with executive producer and fellow auteur Wes Anderson on last years equally sublimely funny/sad The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) and his latest, a blend of Salinger and Updike suggests a novella come to life and one of the years finest comedic dramas.",True
"Mulholland Drive? Thats where I was going!The case history of Mulholland Dr. is known: What should had been another excursion (after Twin Peaks) into the rivaled field of T Vseries ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies Eraserhead, Blue Velvet or Wild at Heart kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here.Mulholland Dr. is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from Eraserhead and Lost Highway, but it never seemed to be unfinished work. In the internet I came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. Is it because it wants to destroy his toy? Does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? Transferring this to Mulholland Dr. it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it.David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears  all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. Mulholland Dr. has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldnt want or couldnt imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible.When you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than Lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifest David Lynchs status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynchs world of films. Mulholland Dr. is more than just a sleeper  it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides, the film is a payoff with Hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinctness was hardly dared before.",True
"Elegantly Disturbing and Shallow Ive never been a believer in Gus Van Sant the auteur. Drugstore Cowboy was a quasientertaining and promising first feature most notable for its pretty North Western scenery and the even prettier Heather Graham in her film debut, but nothing too special ever followed, and the Pscyho remake was an abomination on every level. Van Sants mainstream films were successful for reasons beyond his artistic input. To Die For heralded Nicole Kidmans first tour de force, and Good Will Hunting launched the careers of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for better and for worse.Here, with Elephant Van Sant returns to the same pretty North Western scenery (just an in Drugstore Cowboy the movie was filmed on location in Portland, Oregon) and populates it with even prettier young men and women sleepwalking through an interpretation of the events of the Columbine Massacre. Theres an elegant listlessness to the camerawork as Van Sant lulls us into a beautifully mundane day in the life of some random high school students. Theres a creepy undercurrent, not only in the voyeuristic way in which he films his young charges, but also in the long lingering single shots of students walking through hallways and sidewalks from behind. Suddenly, as the plot of two alienated young men comes to fruition, you realize that the camerawork is meant to copy the killerseyeview of the violent and sadistic video games the young men play before making it a reality at their school. Theres a rising tension that few filmmakers have been able to craft, and for that Van Sant deserves accolades.For all the artificial prettiness, this is without a doubt a highly disturbing viewing experience. In the end, some of it seemed too random (what was the point of the Benny character or the kiss in the shower?), and it culminates ambiguously with all the loose ends untethered. A more capable storyteller would have offered a conclusion, but all Van Sant leaves us is with some haunting classical music and beautiful shot of a cloud covered North Western sky.",True
"This is not Norman Rockwells America I can recall first seeing King of the Hill shorty after its initial release when I wasnt much older than the main character, Aaron (Jesse Bradford, who displays the natural swagger of a young George Clooney here). I was totally enthralled by the story, and this was one of the pieces that ushered in my complete love for and eerie obsession with Depression Era America.Steven Soderbergh as a director over the years has been wildly all over the map traversing genres and styles from topnotch crackerjack indie flicks (the superb Limey) to vapid starstudded populist entertainment (the Oceans series) to entertaining star vehicles (the excellent Erin Brockovich) to overblown misguided message movies (Traffic) to Kubrickian quandaries (the unfairly maligned Solaris). In 1993, still in his formative early years, he hit all the right notes with his vividly detailed and heartbreaking tale of a young boy (Bradford) abandoned in a sleazy hotel room on the edge of a Hooverville in 1933 St. Louise by his flaky salesman father, consumption riddled mother, and little brother who got shipped off to live with relatives so he wouldnt starve to death. The boy lies, steals, woos girls and wins academic awards at school propelled only by his keen wit and innate will to survive. Soderbergh brilliantly abandons almost all sentimentality (the exchanges between the brothers are heartfelt but raw, between mother and son tragically subdued, and between father and son frightfully cold yet honest) and views not the actions of the characters through the lens of our modern moral codes, but through the lens of the era in which the characters survived.Special note has to be given to the cinematography, which in lesser period pieces can so easily succumb to stylish excess. The film looks real and puts you right there in the middle of this American quagmire. Theres also one amazingly rendered shot of a traffic cop holding up a squealing street urchin by the ear after capturing the boy stealing an apple that is so painstakingly lighted and framed that it serves as the complete flipside of your classic Norman Rockwell painting from the same era.Viewing this film recently on cable, I was even more transfixed than the first time over thirteen years ago. Theres also delight to be found in seeing Oscar winner Adrien Brody in his first major role as Aarons big brother role model, and Grammy winner Lauryn Hill in a nice bit part as a sympathetic gumchewing elevator operator.Although historically little seen, this film has been universally lauded, and as the early masterwork of an Oscar winning director, its a crime that there has been no DVD release.",False
"Top film!Probably my favourite film of 2013 so far. Gripping all the way through, with all the aspects you need from a feature length film. Yes, it has the obvious overtone of filth, but its not at all in its nature... its humorous and very touching at times. I think the casting is brilliant and I have a new found respect for James Mc Avoy, who in previous films I have found to be almost nondescript. He shines here, brighter than most Oscar winning performers Ive seen. Ray Donovans Eddie Marson is also fantastic in his role, so well cast  hes funny and warm in such a subtle way. This is not one of those situations when someone can rightly say the book is better  I think the job has been done so well of adapting it into film format that the book is not better at all, just a different experience. It is honestly a film I want to see again. I think an instant classic, not filthy at all, but pure class.",False
"Falling Short of Greatness...Again Scorsese has such an encyclopedic knowledge and understanding of cinema that every shot, however inventive and daring, is effortlessly composed. The direction, editing and cinematography are all the firstrate work by individuals who are clearly masters of their profession and the production design, costumes and makeup are the best youll see all year. Their efforts combine to create a world of rich and lavish color, of excitement and glamour. Who wouldnt want to visit THIS Cotton Club in 1935? Its hard to imagine who could trump the technical team for Oscars this year.With such a perfectly realized world in which to perform, the actors universally do an outstanding job. Despite the criticism of the hardcore Di Capriohaters, the unprejudiced will observe an excellent performance that takes genuine risks and convincingly conveys the passing of more than twenty years. Importantly, Di Caprio more than holds his own when paired with Cate Blanchett and especially Alan Alda, who both give equally note worthy performances. Blanchetts interpretation of Katherine Hepburn seems spot on, and anyone familiar with the late actresses mannerisms will appreciate the hard work that clearly went into the recreation. Alda, one of the most consistently underrated actors around, delivers another masterclass in restrained character building as he oozes ambition and political dishonesty from every pore.And yet, despite the obvious talent of all those involved and Scorseses ability to effortlessly fill three hours, something about The Aviator fails to completely satisfy. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot. What was the drive of The Aviator? A rich guy recklessly spends lots of money to indulge his personal obsessions and gets away with it. Were never told how his experiences change him, and without change theres no journey. Considering the screenplay was written by John Logan, who usually displays a keen interest in showing the emotional evolution of his characters, the oversight is inexplicable. Ultimately then, much like Gangs of New York, The Aviator is simply the sum of its parts, and however brilliantly those parts are realized, there doesnt seem to be a bigger theme to underpin and drive them.The Aviator is a perfectly realized recreation of the era and one well worth experiencing. But the lack of a real emotional journey suggests all gloss and no substance, and ultimately prevents the movie from being truly great.",True
"One step short of movie heaven This movie is very, very good. Unlike some others I do not think the unchronological storytelling hurts the movie, on the contrary I think that the pieces that the viewer has to put together in order to get the picture of the whole story just make it more interesting. On the other hand, no matter how good the movie actually is it is one step short of masterpiece. It is like you are climbing to heaven but you cannot make it over the last step. The story is good, the filming is good, the acting is good, but there is still SOMETHING missing for this movie to be added to my hall of all time faves. Maybe it is the music, this film does not have a strong score, maybe all the components do not add up well together... It is hard to describe why, but I was not as stunned as I usually am after watching movies I rate at 10. Thus, I was deciding between 8 a 9, finally I voted 9 but it is a rather weak one.",False
"This movie has it all and delivers This movie is based on true events and plays on the audiences emotions on every level. It tells a tale of brothersisterhood, love, friendships, and dedication to family. Most importantly, it shows the extremes of humanity...how we as human beings can be so cruel but yet be so kind and caring. And as dramatic a movie as this was, there were several humorous points to ease the tensions of what this movie was really about. Also, just when youre thinking youre watching a movie starring Reese Witherspoon, the accompanying cast of Sudanese refugees steal the show. Great story, great directing, great cast, and great acting all around.A Good Lie was possibly the best movie at TIFF this year.",True
"an especially bad movie Ive rated several hundred movies on IMDB, and overall, I go easy on them. Most of the soso ones get a 5 or 6.  A movie has to be pretty bad to get a 4 or 3 from me.  And movies with a 2 are simply, awful, awful movies.I have saved the rating of 1 exclusively for Batman and Robin, for Im pretty sure no movie could possibly suck more.Normally, when I walk into a theatre with low expectations for some movie, this gives the movie an advantage since Ive basically lowered the bar for it.  I held low expectations for Jurassic Park, but ended up being surprisingly entertained.Batman and Robin failed completely to meet even the rockbottom expectations I held for it when I saw it.The script is a complete wreck.  The jokes are an insult to your intelligence.  The acting isnt especially bad, but then again, very little is required of the actors.  The action sequences are confusing and incoherent.If youre a Batman fan, then you will hate what Joel Shoemaker did in this film.  His bastardization of Bane pretty much kills any possibility of a Knightfallbased movie.  If youre not a big Batman fan, youll just hate this movie just because its so freakin stupid.Any pros?  Well, Ive read some reviews that say the sets are beautifully constructed.  Personally, I thought the sets were ok, but hardly anything special.  Nothing that couldnt by done with lots of construction paper and elmers glue.So, no, there arent really any pros.",False
"Outstanding Performances!Monsters Ball is presented by Director Marc Forster as a dark, dreary filmnoir like drama involving the role of fate in bringing together two different but distraught people from different races.The film opens as preparations are underway for the execution of Lawrence Musgrave (Sean Combs). Two of the prison guards are Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and his son Sonny (Heath Ledger). Musgraves wife Leticia (Halle Berry) and his obese son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) have come to see Musgrave to say their final goodbyes. Hank and Sonny live with the bigoted Buck who is Hanks father and who was also a prison guard. We learn that Buck has apparently bullied Hank all his life and now Hank is doing likewise to Sonny.Following the execution, two tragic but unrelated events occur in the lives of Hank and Leticia. Hank, fighting off the predjudices taught him by his father, begins to fall for Leticia and eventually an interracial relationship ensues. But what if she finds out that Hank had a part in executing her husband?Berry deservedly won the 2001 Academy Award as best actress for her role as the tragic Leticia. She displays a wide range of emotions from pity to sadness to dispare to ecstacy to happiness. Thornton is equally good as the similarly tragic Hank who goes through much of the same emotional changes. Peter Boyle is also excellent as the bigoted Buck. Ledger, in an all too brief role, shines as the son who really doesnt want to follow in his fathers footsteps. Calhoun evokes pity and sorrow as Leticias son and the old Puffmeister, Combs gives a good low key performance as the doomed convict.An excellent film but be forewarned that there are a couple of graphic sex scenes in the movie. Definitely not for the kiddies.",False
"Welcome back Mr Gibson When thinking about war films, its very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss phenomenal story of courage saw him singlehandedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. Its the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing youll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and theyre wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider Man films but its great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought Id see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and thats why I have to say its a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. Its right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.",True
"Fascinating Film; Hardly Gimmicky Rope is one of the finer films that Hitchcock made.  Philosophy, sociology and psychology are contained in equal parts.  The plot is simple, the characters are complex and Hitchcocks treatment of the Leopold and Loeb parallel quite deft.  The final soliloquy from Jimmy Stewarts character, Rupert, is not only one of the finest examples of Stewarts acting abilities but also of filmmaking.On the subject of filmmaking  Hitchcock filmed this in as much of a single take as possible.  I believe there are only five edits in the whole thing. I can wholeheartedly tell you that it was no gimmick on Hitchcocks part. The plays plot requires that a certain amount of tension be maintained. Tracking shots are used for this purpose and quite well in my opinion. Timing, position and prop movements alone are to force us to stand in awe of a logistical challenge.  All the actors are played superbly.  The dialogue is natural and flowing.  The finest bit of timing involves a swinging kitchen door, the rope, and the fear of discovery.In short, this is a fine film that cannot disappoint.  Highly recommended and will be well worth your time.",True
"Better than expected, but far from greatness.Puss in Boots is a perfect example of a movie I absolutely never would have seen if I hadnt gotten a pass to a free screening. And if I had gone to see it — and, to reiterate, I wouldnt have — theres simply no way I would have seen it in 3D. But it was free, so I did. I guess you could say I had low expectations.Some background: I loved Shrek, I basically couldnt stand Shrek 2, in part because I found the Puss in Boots character more annoying than charming, and I never bothered with the other Shrek sequels. Life is just too short. So I expected Puss in Boots to be, at best, tolerable, stupid, and intermittently funny. Imagine my surprise when I found that it was somewhat better than tolerable, more than intermittently funny, and actually kind of clever.The story, as should be expected from a member of the Shrek lineage, plays fast and loose with fairy tale characters, plot points, and conventions. Puss, an orphaned cat now branded as an outlaw, joins forces with Humpty Dumpty, an egg of questionable intent, and Kitty Softpaws, a feline fatale, to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill, grow a magic beanstalk, and find the golden goose of legend. Naturally, things dont go according to plan, and the plot thickens. Its pointless, but fun.There are instances of real invention here. The first is the setting, which is sort of a medieval spaghetti western, although the western card was played better in Rango. There are several great visual gags, like what happens to Humptys covered wagon, and a dance fight that is easily the best part of the movie. Without giving anything away, Ill also say that, the more you think about the identity of the monster, the funnier, and the more fitting, it becomes. However, the storytelling is sloppy at times. Theres at least one plot point that is dispensed with far too quickly, and the fate of one character simply doesnt make sense. Still, it all kind of works, and the good parts are good enough to help you forget the shortcomings.Ultimately, the movie is saved by its pacing and its animation, which, as much as I hate to admit it, is absolutely stunning in 3D. I cant recommend paying the 3D upcharge, but I will say that those who do will probably not be disappointed. This isnt a cheap, gimmicky use of 3D, but one that actual adds depth and detail. There was one particular scene, a chase that, oddly enough, reminded me of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, where I found the use of 3D really creative. Would I pay for the 3D? Probably not, but for those looking for a 3D experience, you could do a lot worse.Puss in Boots also raises the question of whether or not its worth it to have major stars as voice actors. Actually, I take it back. This movie doesnt so much raise that question as answer it, resoundingly, with a no. As much fun as Antonio Banderas is as Puss, Im not convinced that he brings anything to the role that a lesser known actor couldnt have brought. Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis are completely wasted as Kitty and Humpty. Billy Bob Thornton is a good choice as Jack, but thats largely because of the clever writing. Understand what Im saying: Im not being critical of these actors work. I am being critical of the decision to cast them in a picture like this, where the most clever aspects of their characters come from the animation, not from the vocal performances. My suggestion would be to save the money needed to hire such big names, and use lesser known actors, perhaps from Broadway. That way, it would be easier for Puss in Boots, a movie that many people will approach with a deserved amount of skepticism, to make money, and struggling actors will find more work. Believe me, the movie wont suffer from it.This isnt high art. Its not nearly the equal of Shrek, and it doesnt have one iota of the heart of most Pixar films, or of Dream Works How to Train Your Dragon. But at the same time, its not bad for what it is. Its clever, witty, wellmade, and fastpaced. Its nothing like a masterpiece, but as far as diversions go, its quite diverting.",False
"It was a pretty cute Felt very derivative of Intouchables I did however really enjoy the romance that was in this film.Emilia Clark has the most expressive face I have ever seen on camera.Watch her eyebrows! Thats all I have to say. You could almost watch this entire movie just staring at her eyebrows I had a hard time not doing that.I really enjoyed her character. She is a silly, eccentric, perpetually happy girl. With a pretty eclectic sense of style.Emilia Clarke was perfectly cast for this role.She ventures far from her intense power house character the Mother of Dragons from Game of Thrones.At times it was hard to tell if Emilia Clarke the actress is just extremely expressive with her face, or if it was something she was doing for the role which I suppose speaks to how well she did.Because Im thinking she was exaggerating it, therefore she played the part marvellously.The male lead is Sam Claflin, who you will more than likely recognize but not be able to place. His largest role as of late is the water proficient fighter from the Hunger Games.I also feel he played the part very well. No complaints, He has a great smile, or smirk, that he does through out, which allows us to empathize with him a little more when he seeming unlikable.There are a lot of light moments, actually the whole movie has a very light tone to it its a serious topic, but with Clarkes character its hard for anything to be too serious or solemn. There are those sombre moments, which is, Im sure, why I was given a tissue box at the advance screening.There were only a few editing aspects I didnt enjoy. There were far too many cuts in certain scenes Emilia walking up to the mansion for the first time and her conversation on the bench with her boyfriend. They were distracting. This was sprinkled throughout the film to greater or lesser degrees.I think the film looked pretty, great locations. And a wonderful set, really. The house Claflins character lives in looks very nice. I loved all the walls that opened when pushed on. Very modern, and expensive Im sure.There is a little treat for any Harry Potter fans! Neville Longbottom, all grown up and looking fit, he plays the part of Emilia Clarkes boyfriend. I hope to see him in more roles, maybe even a lead one day.As for family friendliness, this movie is a G, it is good to go. In the opening scene Claflin is presumably being intimate with his girlfriend, they are obviously naked, but nothing is shown, they are under sheets.There is no cursing or obscenities in this movie worth mentioning.",False
"a must see (NO SPOILERS)I saw Remember Me a an advanced screening on Monday. A few points:1. The trailers on television do not do this movie justice. This is not a light fluffy love story like I expected it to be. Its pretty intense and has some very poignant scenes.2. Dont let the fact that Robert Pattinson is in the movie deter you from seeing it. This movie is nothing like Twilight, and he does a great job in the role of Tyler.I went into the movie thinking it was going to be stupid and predictable...I was only going to see it because it was free. After leaving the theater, I was very glad I saw the movie and would have paid $10 to see the movie.",False
"A Majestical, Awe Inspiring Masterpiece What can I say?  George Stevens Giant is a prototype for what a classic epic film should be like.  It takes time to develop its two main characters, and it does a good job of examining the social milieu and environment (Texas) that the characters inhabit.  Rock Hudsons performance reminds me of Richard Burtons in the underrated Joseph Mankiewieks film Cleopatra, and indeed, there are many parallels (which I wont go into) between Rock Hudsons character and Marc Anthony.  Similarly, Elizabeth Taylors character in Giant (radiant and wonderful as usual) resembles Cleopatra in many ways.  One can argue that Giant is the story of Anthony and Cleopatra transported to Texas.  And its almost heartbreaking to see James Dean in his last performance. . . the flow of generations, the gaps between the older and the newer generations, the passing on off dreams by ancestors, the influence of the dead on the living, tradition versus modernity, the lasting and everchanging nature of love. . . these are all issues which Giant addresses eloquently and majestically.  Oh, and there is a tenminute section in Giant which has got to be one of the best cinematic passages I have ever seen.  In this passage, without the use of and sound or music, George Stevens portrays death and rebirth through the generations. . . its nothing short of astonishing!",True
"A different kind of movie..This great picture by the greatly discussed Spike Lee is one of a kind. What really makes this shine through the constant rubble being made by either incompetent directors or inexperienced ones is first of all, the incredible acting and for that you need great characters that are well thoughtout and second comes the frighteningly real and tragic story. Which Lee handles with utmost care and outstanding precision.Lees trademarks are present here and the cinematography suits the feel of the movie very well. The final product feels very polished, but true to the story and it is those small things that some of us notice, those details that separate a veteran from a novice. There are some weak points, but they are only minor.The acting here is top notch. Norton convinces once again and makes for a great heartfelt performance and Hoffman is equally impressive. However, I was completely blown away by Pepper. Barry Pepper. He was continuously Frank and very consistent in his acting. The scene where he breaks down and Norton thanks him in a way for what he has done is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen. It felt so authentic.Furthermore, I can keep writing about how great this movie is or how good the acting, but eventually you have to decide for yourself. I can only recommend it.So, I say to you, if you can, see this movie as soon as possible.",True

"At first, wasnt the biggest fan but.....I couldnt help but set rather high expectations for The Usual Suspects as I went into watching this. I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited The Usual Suspects is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.Around 4550 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A",True
"Funny, sweet, inventive and wonderfully acted A wonderfully funny fable of the adventures of worlds greatest hotel concierge (a brilliant, inventive and hilarious performance by Ralph Fiennes) and the friendship he strikes up with the hotels new lobby boy (a strong debut by newcomer Tony Revolori). The story goes in many unexpected directions, every one entertaining and eccentric, and the cast is full of first rate highly comic performances by F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here. While not Andersons most profound film, it may be his most joyful. I dont think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed out loud quite a few times. And yet, as in any good fable, there is some real poignancy as well. A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted artfilm and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with such panache. Even my friends who dont enjoy Andersons work in general had nothing but good things to say. The sweetest treat of the movie year so far.",True

This is a great movie, with truly great acting for all involved.The 1969 movie was driven fully by Rooster Cogburn. This 2010 version is truly driven by Mattie Ross. The performances by Stienfeld, Bridges, and Damon shine. I would have liked to have seen Stienfeld and Damon against John Wayne. Bridges was terrific as Cogburn. The story was far better than I imagined it could have been.I cant believe I said all this. I am one who absolutely hates remakes. Like I said this is not the same movie.",True
"Bergmans ultimate best Swedish director Ingmar Bergman has a reputation for dark, intellectual and introspective dramas, which is only partly justified because many of his early movies were rather lighthearted. Here is the longest movie he did (three hours), and the theatrical version is only half of the original which was twice as long. But length should not stop you from watching this jewel of a film, which is both complex and accessible. After all, Gone with the Wind is just as long.Fanny and Alexander isnt exactly a family movie, but it is a movie about family. Family seen in all its different facets through the eyes of two children. The film is divided into three very different parts, each of them showing a different aspect of family life. It is set in Uppsala, Sweden (Bergmans native city), at the turn of the twentieth century. The story begins on Christmas Eve, and we are plunged right away into a fairytale atmosphere.Fanny and Alexanders family seems a happy one, actually a family of theatre actors. During the Christmas Eve party held at the grandmothers heavilyfurnished house, the atmosphere is joyful at first glance, especially for the children who obviously feel very much at home. But reality is not just what it seems. The childrens father is seriously ill. One of the uncles is manicdepressive, and the other is a skirtchaser who has an affair with the young maid while his wife shows a lot of comprehension. Even the grandmother keeps a secret affair with a Jewish banker (played by Erland Josephson, a Bergman regular) that has lasted for many years.The childrens world collapse as their father dies. Soon after, their still young and beautiful mother marries the bishop, whose name is Vergerus (thats the name of the villain in all Bergmans movies, dont ask me why). The atmosphere in the bishops house could not be more different from the childrens first home. It is bare, silent, freezing. Alexander and the bishop hate each other from the start. This hate culminates when the bishop flogs Alexander to punish him, during a suffocating scene. War is declared from then on. Although the childrens mother is pregnant, she already regrets her second marriage and seeks help from her former family.The grandmas Jewish friend, who is also sort of a magician, manages to kidnap the children by a clever stratagem. They are sheltered in his house, which is full of puppets and mysterious objects. There, a strange nephew of his lives in seclusion (the role is played by a woman). From then on, reality and fantasy get blurred, but what is certain is that the evil bishop meets a cruel fate, and the childrens mother finally makes it back to her former home. The film ends as it began, with a party. Two new babies are just born : the mothers baby she had from the wicked bishop, and the maids baby with the luscious uncle. The two of them are accepted immediately as part of the family, which is a rather precocious sign of Scandinavian openmindedness (in 1900, illegitimate children were generally rejected as bastards).Despite the title, attention is focused much more on Alexander than on Fanny. She is there all the time but speaks little, while showing unconditional solidarity with her brother. A possible reason is that the movie seems to have strong autobiographical elements, more than any other Bergman, and if so, Alexander seems to incarnate Bergman himself as a child. Bergmans father happened to be a minister, and the director confessed that he was raised in a very oppressive manner. Thus, it is quite possible that Alexanders step family is a representation of Bergmans real family, while Alexanders real family is the family Bergman had dreamed of, unsurprisingly a family of actors.This film also displays the most accomplished use that Bergmans renowned photographer Sven Nykvist ever made of color. He was a long time reluctant to color and kept shooting in black and white well into the sixties. Bergmans first color movies had nothing special, until Cries and whispers where an obsessive use of red started to appear. The color contrasts are very strong in Fanny and Alexander, and are especially used to underline the difference between the grandmothers colorful home and the bishops house which is mostly all black and white. There are many characters in this story, and all the major adult roles are played by actors who are all very famous in Sweden. There is a special appearance by Harriet Andersson, who played the female lead in many Bergmans of the fifties, especially well remembered as the whimsical Monika. Here, she is ungratefully cast as the bishops elderly tormented servant who likes scaring the children with horror stories. As for the young maid, she is played Pernilla Wallgren, who married Danish director Bille August and became later famous as Pernilla August. She played the lead in The best intentions directed by Bille August but based on a script by Bergman, and also taking place in Uppsala at the turn of the twentieth century...",False
"Its full of ****HBO and Peter Gould did a disservice to the American people by stuffing their nose up the ass of Wall Street and the Federal Reserve bank by not even coming close to laying blame where it belongs. The film is almost comical in its representation of Paulsen, Bernanke and Geithner. All three of these clowns are characterized as heroic as they struggle to save﻿ the American economy from collapsing. The film is mostly fiction and is clearly an attempt to hide the truth from the American people. I would recommend watching a more truthful depiction of what actually happened, as for example Inside Job which is actually a documentary and not a fictional representation. This is all in all, nothing but propaganda.",True
"The world is an evil place Charlie. Some of us make money off that and others get destroyed.Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead is directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Kelly Masterson. It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris and Amy Ryan. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Ron Fortunato.Two brothers with differing financial problems plan to rob their parents jewellery store. But when all does not go to plan and tragedy strikes, it sends them, and those close to them, into a world of fear, shame and violence.....It opens with a raunchy sex scene, man and wife in the throes of committed passion, for these brief moments there is pleasure. Once over, though, it proves to be a false dawn, the last time anyone on screen will taste pleasure in Lumets biting morality tale. From here on in the film unfolds in a dizzying array of multiperspectives and over lapping of narrative structure, a three pronged assault on the senses as a family implodes in a haze of greed, lies and inadequacies. A botched robbery underpins the plotting, the aftermath of which is what is most cutting, we zip around learning the wherewithal and whys of the key players, learning exactly what we need to know to fully immerse in this bleak world. This is a world populated by love cheats, drug abuse, embezzling, bad parenting and blackmail, a world where the brothers Hanson (Hoffman & Hawke) now dwell, either ill equipped (Hawkes Hank) or stuck between idiocy and smug evil (Hoffmans Andy). Their folly, their greed, impacting with a juddering severity on the family circle.My life, it doesnt add up. Nothing connects to anything else. Im not the sum of my parts. All my parts dont add up to one...me.It would be Lumets last film (he passed away in 2011), thankfully it is a fitting final offering from the talented Philadelphian. Hes aided considerably, mind, by a razor sharp script from debut screenplay writer Masterton. Its full of nastiness and tension, but still observational as a family tragedy, with major bonus being that it never resorts to stereotypes or cops out come the crushing denouement. Where Lumet excels is in drawing near faultless performances from his cast. Youthful and downtrodden haplessness portrayed by Hawke, Hoffmans powerhouse manipulator with emotional issues, Tomei proving that over 40 is still sexy while dialling into a very touching performance. Finney, a crackerjack of grief from the wily old fox, Ryans hard edged exwife and Michael Shannon strolling into the picture late in the day exuding notable menace. All splendidly guided by the great director who asks them to portray characters convincing in going deeper for motivations and means.Bleak, brutal and near brilliant across the board. 9/10",True
"Lost Souls Its been a long time since a movie has made me hurt the way this one did. Perhaps hurt isnt the right word.  Ache is more like it.  I could so completely identify with both characters.  Bob is a middleaged actor caught in a life which has lost its zest and purpose, doing what he ought to be doing (making money doing whiskey commercials) instead of doing what he WANTS to do (plays).  And then a young, beautiful, intelligent woman enters his orbit.  On that level alone, with its mute longing and sexual tension, I can identify with him.And then there is Charlotte, a student of philosophy seeking herself, her soul lost and adrift.  She doesnt know who she is, doesnt know what she wants.  Her life is a quest for authenticity of self.  And I identify with her because so much of my life I have been seeking the same thing.This movie isnt for everyone.  They will call it boring, lifeless, limp. There are people, I realize, who have never experienced that kind of longing, who had never sought meaning in their lives, and searched for their own lost souls.  They live for the here and now, without giving a thought to the spiritual aspects of life.  A friend said introverts will love this movie, extraverts will hate it.  I think that is a fair surface assessment.  This movie is all about the inner lives of two people whose souls connect for a brief time in an alien city. It is a love affair not of bodies, but of minds and spirits.Some this movie will make angry.  Some this movie will make weep.",False
"There were some serious acting chops behind the legend...The early, violent death of someone so famous was a tragedy; but for someone whos never seen a Dean performance (East of Eden is his only movie Ive seen to date; it has since been joined by Rebel Without a Cause as of Nov. 2007, and Giant, in Jan. 2010) its easy to get suckered by these details into believing that this is the only thing that adds substance to the man. Not so.In East of Eden he delivers an intense performance as, unsurprisingly, an enigma; an individual too sensitive for life in his own world. It sounds from this as if it could well be similar territory to Rebel Without a Cause, and given the events its also perhaps not too far away from the real person  but nevertheless its a striking portrayal that shows unmistakable fire and talent.James Dean is not one of those people whove come to be mythologised due to outside circumstances entirely beyond their control; for the consummate skill in his craft and the posthumous Oscar recognition brings something just as weighty to the table. About as far removed from the Orlando Bloom poster boy of his generation as its possible to be, my expectations were completely trumped. There was real depth present, too.All else is at least good, but its the memory of a sobbing Cal all at once being transformed into a creature of hidden menace that I will take away with me. A riveting display from a fine actor, and undoubtedly a lasting testament to a lamentably short career. 9/10.",True
"An elephant?For some reason I expected more of a documentary, so this docudrama nearly had me out the door, but the authoritative man in the grey lab coat persuaded me to stay.It clearly, and to my understanding, accurately, lays out the format of the notorious Milgram Experiment, which is necessary for all that follows; the public and academic backlash, our involvement as we question whether we would behave like Milgrams subjects, and his own soulsearching. To be sure, he comes across as quite coldhearted, and more selfdoubt would have made a more interesting story. Instead, all of the doubt is carried by his colleagues and Wynona Ryder as his patient wife.The original experiment is wellenough represented that the recreation of a TV series about it (with Kellan Lutz as a young William Shatner playing the Milgram character) has some amusingly obvious elements of parody, and hence selfparody of this film.The film has some unsettling features over and above the experiments themselves  scenes carried out in colour in front of poorly placed monochrome backprojections, and an elephant, yes, a real, if slightly out of focus elephant behind Peter Sarsgaard as he talks to the camera walking towards us along a university corridor. Why? If its The Elephant In The Room, what are we not seeing? As Milgram points out, he and his experiment are treated with opprobrium, but the results are accepted, and serve their purpose. While the Holocaust is repeatedly invoked (including footage of the Eichmann trial), and Milgram twice mentions that his name is Hebrew for pomegranate (in fact its not but milgrom is the Yiddish), an obvious ethical parallel is not mentioned: the Nazi experiments of killing prisoners with Xrays, which are still shown (usually on an optin basis) to medical students.",True
"It helps to have an appreciation for Ken Russell, not Pete Townsend This is a Ken Russell movie, make no mistake. It is relentlessly twisted, ugly, savage (for a sometimes humorous effect) and trippy. Russell may be the oldest flower child of all time. Surreal plot concerns a deafdumbandblind boy becoming the new Messiah to a pinballcrazed population, and the film has been accused of being too literal to The Whos rock opera source material. In this age of lavish music videos, it has also been tagged as archaic. Though nobody seems to care anymore how a film was perceived in its time, I would say the picture still succeeds in doing what was originally intended: shake an audience up with freaky visuals and propulsive music (nicely arranged). It also does something else: creates actual characters from the music, a plus due in part to the fine acting of Ann Margret as Tommys glamorous mother, Roger Daltrey as Tommy, Oliver Reed as Tommys stepfather (Reed is hammy but quite game, while the role is designed as both a villain and a hero), and Tina Turner, an extremely scary presence as the Acid Queen. Tommy has some bummer scenes, and Russells love for degradation occasionally made me wince, but it is a real cinematic experience. Whether it involves or alienates the viewer depends on their appreciation for the English directors constant penchant for the bizarre. **1/2 from ****",False
"West vs East If a slightly faster pace action movie with lots of soggy romance to appease both parties on a date is your aim, then this is just fine.That being said, not to be a wet blanket but did anyone check the copyright for this story idea? If anyone watches Eastern movies or reads Manga they will know that in 1999 a book titled Battle Royale was written with the exact same theme and later adapted into two Manga comics and movies(2000 and 2003{Battle Royale: Requiem} respectively.In Battle Royale students are kidnapped at different times to be used in a military research activity called The Program where they must fight to the death on an isolated island. In here the stakes are higher(i.e., metal tracking collars with explosives that will kill any insurgents and are all set to detonate simultaneously if no one is killed in a 24 hour period).Personally, Hunger Games was a cheap knockoff of the Battle Royale series sanitized to withing an inch of its politically incorrect life and a complete waste of my time and brain cells.",False
"Allen back on form...We begin with shots of Paris (yes, some of them in the rain) and I think Im looking at a travelogue; but Im wrong. Once it gets going this film is very witty and even whimsical at times, and I really enjoyed it. Woody Allens writing is spot on here with some great dialogue and some marvellous characters. The plot has just the right amount of mystery to keep me interested and even has some important points about living your life in the past. All the performances were excellent with Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard getting top marks from me. Over all I found it very entertaining, amusing and even a little profound in places Well worth a look!Steel Monsters verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.5/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a Steel Monster.",True
"A thoughtful and plausible examination of guilt.Very well acted and presented and a faithful representation of the main points of the novel on which it is based. This film encourages us to look closely at very difficult issues surrounding the atrocities of World War II. I am at a loss to understand why so many critics have been so damning of it. Perhaps it is too subtle for them to understand. It seeks to outlaw the false and intellectually lazy theory to explain the holocaust, namely that the horrors were committed by monsters. In its place we are offered contextualization, not as excuse but as explanation of how quite ordinary people were able to do extraordinarily dreadful things. We avoid these uncomfortable facts at our peril.",True
"Take your meds and watch it I did enjoy this film. Its a nice piece of Gothic melodrama rather than a Gothic horror (as its made out to be) not least because its concern is to humanise rather than exploit its subject matter. 19th (and 20th) century mental asylums were fascinating and terrifying places, and fortunately or unfortunately depending on your opinion the film doesnt really explore the worst horrors that took place in those institutions. Etc is one of the abuses that used to be forced on people, but since its still in some circumstances used today (as it can be effective for treating depression amongst other things) its got a slightly ambiguous status as an horror treatment (although Ive met people who were profoundly angry at being forced to undergo it). Despite this  the film works very well, not least because we never know quite what to expect from Ben Kingsley and the always top notch David Thewlis as the villains of the piece, and to go with the melodrama theres some genuine villainy & tragedy to keep the narrative going not to mention a few twists and turns.Ive no idea how this relates to the tale by Edgar Allen Poe, but the director / writers have managed to balance the sense you get when reading a Wilkie Collins novel or other 19th century melodrama with the (slightly) more critical perspective we have today, although having said that the idea of a therapeutic community  an idea implicit in much of the film  remains quite controversial even today, where drug treatments as a first line of intervention remain the norm rather than the exception. Combined with this is the equally perhaps more controversial idea that sanity is a function of the society we live in  something which is definitely true to some extent  as in the example of hysteria the film addresses  but to what extent is far more controversial? The solution conjured at the end may or may not be if you like a psychotic departure from reality depending on your opinion on the nature of mental illness. Overall then a very nice little film, with a great cast, and good pacing.",False
"A Joyful Film About Death As usual Altman will divide his audience in a radical way. He, clearly, doesnt do it on purpose but it happens more often than not with the works of real artists where there is no room (or very little) for concessions. It is what it is, his vision, his whole. He mentioned that the film was about death and found that not everyone agreed not even some of his closest and more devoted collaborators. Thats what he saw, thats what it is but its bound to be contradicted by critics and audiences alike. Personally, I dont think Ill see a better film this year. The work of an idiosyncratic artist and masterful craftsman doesnt hit the main stream screens every day of the week. My only reservation is that the film is too short. I wanted to go on and on and on. To say that Meryl Streep is sublime seems kind of redundant but never mind, she is, sublime, surprising, funny, very funny, moving, very, very moving. Lily Tomlin and Meryl have the best moments in the film. They appear, look and sound as if they had been working together all their lives. Total chemistry. Lindsay Lohan is the biggest surprise. Good for her. Thats the way to forge a way ahead. Work with the best. Woody Harrelson and John C Reilly are simply glorious. Kevin Kline does a Kevin Kline in the most enchanting way. It was also a delight to see Garrison Keillor himself playing himself, not just wonderfully but very convincingly as well. I recommend it with all my heart.",False
"A fantastic film by a great director We need to talk about Kevin is easily one of the most harrowing films Ive ever seen and left me completely empty. Lynne Ramsey succeeds where so many others dealing with a similar subject matter have failed, as she abstains from sensationalism and bloody detail. Instead she focuses in on character and relationship development and breakdown.Tilda Swinton gives a truly great performance and even though the main thread of the story is clear almost from the start, she and the rest of the terrific cast manage to keep the viewer glued to the screen.One of the most interesting facets of the film was that it showed how much power children can hold and execute over adults if they are given the opportunity.We need to talk about Kevin is quality from start to finish and deserves to become a classic. Im looking forward to seeing many more films by Lynne Ramsay.",True
"Life as performance  a surreal Parisian trip Holy Motors is like a more outthere version of the films of Charlie Kaufman. You should expect surreal surprises, and my advice would be to not read too much about it before watching it, so you can just let the film happen to you, like an art experience. Dont expect this story of a man (a fully committed Denis Lavant) taking on 9 different personas in a day in Paris to make any neat logical sense, this is a film of dreams and ideas  music, madness, death, sex, despair and comedy. It seems to be about questions around acting  what does it mean to be an actor? arent we all playing the part of our own lives? what does performing a role cost us? how does a performance manage to move us so intensely? I saw this at the Sydney Film Festival with a large audience, and it was interesting listening to peoples laughter. Sometimes that was in response to a comic scene, but at other times it seemed more that a startling idea or image left some people not knowing how else to respond (eg a very odd short scene near the end, as Denis ends his workday, caused some people to laugh, while I found it terribly moving). The delight is in the individual scenes, though some of the scenarios have a real sadness to them: the motion capture scene, where human movement proves spellbinding in a way that CGI can never be; the sad tale of the daughter returning home after a party; the wonderfully crazed and uncomfortable Eva Mendes segment (make sure you check out the writing on the gravestones); and the surprisingly dramatic scene featuring pop icon Kylie Minogue (whose other film appearances were never anything like this). The tone and quality isnt consistent the whole way through, which can feel like a flaw, but it also keeps you on your toes. You might find parts of it pretentious or difficult to interpret, but the next moment you may be moved and not know why. It will definitely make most of the films youve watched recently seem very very dull.",True
"Unexpectedly Brilliant Critics shouldnt be criticizing films they dont understand. Xavier Dolans movies are extremely subtle in their acting and dialogues which I think makes it more difficult for non French speakers to understand. This is especially true for this film since the movie is based upon the impossibility to communicate. Thats probably why most of the bad reviews come from American newspapers. I mean, Im French and I honestly admire non French speaking fans of Dolan because subtitles arent enough to communicate the subtlety of each word and tone. Aside from that its only a matter of taste.I agree on the fact that some characters are a bit stereotyped, especially during the scenes in which the whole family is gathered. However each actor has a scene in which they speak in private with Louis and thats when their characters get interesting. The film is aesthetically brilliant and allows you to understand things only eyes can communicate. The movie constantly creates an emotional tension, something Ive rarely felt.",True
"One of the best films ever  a lot of people missed the point Its ironic that Im saying many people missed the point because I did, too. My original review on IM Db gave the film a negative rating. I deleted it months ago because I have since purchased the Directors Cut on DVD and fallen in love with it.The movie is energetic, imaginative and unique. Its taken from Irvine Welshs novel, which I now really want to read. Its about a group of heroin addicts (led by Ewan Mc Gregors Renton) in Scotland who cant seem to live past their addiction...everything centers around drugs.Trainspotting was condemned for promoting drug use, but I agree with fellow reviewer Bob the Moo who claims this was a misinterpretation on the medias behalf  yeah, it may show drugs as being funny at times (like Rentons wacky hallucination) but it certainly doesnt glamorize them. Some of the sequences are sickeningly realistic and depressing  like the scene with the baby. Thats tragic stuff, and totally unexpected. Its also effective because by that point in the film we care about the characters enough for it to affect us on an emotional level.The movie was really popular in the UK but never got much acclaim overseas. Americans in general will always be less liberal and be quicker to damn films for their messages. Taxi Driver was hailed by Europeans in 76...cant really say the same for US critics  it was a huge split in opinion at the time.Ditto here. Most Americans didnt really get it and the only attention it received was the controversy surrounding the appearance of Mr. Mc Gregors genitalia. Oh, the humanity! If you havent seen Trainspotting yet, I highly recommend it. Dont be turned off at first by its bleak humor and sick content  I wont lie, it IS a rough ride...but by the end, its worth it.",True
"Scintillating! Satirical!  Sumptuous!I have come to consider CHICAGO the best and most satisfying movie musical that I have ever seen. And I like movie musicals. The first delight was how well Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C Reilly did with these roles acting, Singing!!, and Dancing!!! I was surprised, and amazed! In addition, the cheeky satire about Americas obsession with the cult of celebrity and the threering circus that the media and opportunistic lawyers make of our justice system is razorsharp and very timely. (Its a little like watching O.J.: The Musical!)The creative and brilliant direction by Rob Marshall is entertaining and wonderful. As I think over the films of the last ten years, this is the first one that comes to mind. I love it!! I simply cant watch without singing along! CHICAGO certainly deserved its Academy Award for Best Picture!!",True
"A very well told story; Short Cuts with lots of sex.This is an excellent movie that is vibrant, colourful and powerful. The performances are all very good, but the big surprise is the return of Burt Reynolds. His performance is the most notable, and he duly rewarded with a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination. Boogie Nights is about the pornography industry in the 70s, and how it all fell apart in the 80s. The first half, revolving around the 70s, is plausible and believable; entertaining and informative. Although the film falls apart in the second half, and descends into a lot of unnecessary, graphic violence.Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is the protagonist of the movie. He is spotted one night at a club by porn king Jack Warner (Reynolds), and is offered a deal to star in a movie. Warner remarks that, I just know theres somethin wonderful under those jeans just waitin to get out. And that marks the entrance for Eddie into the sleazy, slutty, though human world of porn and sex. Boogie Nights follows his first appearance as a naive young actor to a drug hampered, egomaniacal lunatic who spirals down into the world of crime and Cocaine. Along the way, it deals with sub plots dealing with pornography and the surrogate families that establish themselves amidst the echelons; the prejudice that society carries to porn stars and the dirty, utterly disgraceful life they lead.Although the film deals with sex and porn, there is not an obscene amount of it, and the director censors these scenes so it is not explicit. The viewers gather that Eddie Adams (or Dirk Diggler, the pseudonym he assumes for acting) has a prodigious member lurking under his jeans. But, until the final scene, all we see to indicate that is the stunned reactions by peers and onlookers.The script is very good, but the film is overly long. It could be called an epic at a length of 155 minutes, but the time passes quickly. Despite Boogie Nights flaws and shortfalls, it is a very good movie worthy of the acclaim it received.Nine out of ten.",True
"Justice or Vengeance?Gandhi said, An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind. What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielbergs Munich. Munich is powerful and perhaps Spielbergs most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. Munich is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielbergs Munich seen through the eyes of Eric Banas Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. Munich really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, When does it ever end? At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book Vengeance by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values. Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically dont exist.In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a good soldier. Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything Nothing about Munich is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielbergs intention. Munich could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movies power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. When does it ever end? Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. Munich is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",False
"Hitchcocks biopic particularly developing his relationship to Alma Reville and the shooting of Psycho A love story between influential filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) and wife Alma Reville (Alma Reville) during the filming of Psycho (1960) in 1959 . As Alfred decides his next film will adapt the lurid horror novel, Psycho by Robert Bloch , but the novels inspiration haunts his dreams , including the series killer Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) , then Alma finally loses patience . The film mainly deals with filming ¨Psycho¨ , Hithcock masterpiece and his most accomplished and perfect movie . Psycho was not only Hitchcocks biggest successful movie,but was a phenomenon in its own right , the picture is a magnum opus of the terror genre and its immediate impact and its future influence was enormous and cannot be over emphasised . It also concerns on the relationship between Hitch and his wife Alma Reville , perfectly played by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren respectively . Helen Mirren had met the real Alfred Hitchcock when he approached her for a part as a murder victim in his penultimate film, Frenzi (1972) ; Mirren turned down the role, a decision she later regretted. Although many reviewers criticized the film for inventing an intimate relationship between Alma Reville and Whitfield Cook, the facts are documented by more than one Hitchcock scholar, as exemplified by Patrick Mc Gilligan in his biography of Alfred Hitchcock. There are developed various scenes about ¨Psycho ¨shooting as when Marion (Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh) leaves her fiancée and heads with her car toward California , when is caught in a storm she leaves the highway and enter to Bates hotel . The hotel with twelve rooms (and 12 showers) is managed by a strange young named Norman (James D Arcy as Anthony Perkins) who seems to be submitted by his overbearing mother . The shower images are well recreated , these scenes are one of the most studied ,copied and analysed sequences in cinema history and has obtained a notoriety what exceeds of the movie itself. The character of Ed Gein was included in the original screenplay. In subsequent drafts, the role of Gein was either eliminated completely or reduced in importance. Terrific acting by Anthony Hopkins as Hitch and sensitive performance by Mirren as Alma , in fact , this movie is a perceptive homage to a great screenwriter , and Hitchs supporter , Alma Reville . The movie has a fine support cast playing notorious characters who had an important role on Hitch films such as Jessica Biel as Vera Miles , Toni Collette as Peggy Robertson , Michael Stuhlbarg as Lew Wasserman , Ralph Macchio as screen writer Joseph Stefano , Wallace Langham as Saul Bass , Paul Schackman as Bernard Herrmann and Spencer Garrett as George Tomasini . Nice production design , as scenes set in Alfred Hitchcocks Paramount suite of offices were filmed in Hitchcocks actual office on that studios lot. Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth . Lively and atmospheric musical score by Danny Elffmann . The picture was well directed by Sacha Gervasi ; it was shot in 36 days with exquisite taste and intelligence by the master Hitchcock who makes an impeccable control of every scene and maneuvers your emotions, infusing with a deliciously wit and ironic",False
"One of the Most Powerful and True Films Larry Clark has created a true masterpiece of its time.  Kids is an insightful, poignant and harrowing depiction of the life of angst ridden teens in New York City.  Theres Tully, the smooth talking, deflowering (and HIV positive) teen, Casper, the cool, hyped up and not all there teen, and Jennie, the girl who is full of depression and anger for the deflower man.  The film doesnt have much of a direct screenplay (mostly dialogue you would hear while around friends) which is good for the type of movie being made here.  The film gains much controversy by stating whether its true to life, or just a mindless depiction of what could happen in the city.  You could decide that for yourself, but for me, I think this film has more truth, heart and drama (including great dramatic acting and scenes) that most films Ive ever seen.",True
"I love everything about Her This is the best film I have seen all year, and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think its because it is so representational of what its like to be human.There are so many things that make this movie special, but Ill just mention a few. 1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure, you see everything on the screen, which is already beautiful, but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed, I cried, my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster, and the score assisted in that so well. 2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that its predictable and not worth watching, I consider that awesome, because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening, as well as during, I found myself questioning things in my own life that either dont make sense or dont have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. Theyre all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion, moreso than any other film this year, Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas, story, and character development. One of the best scripts ever written. 3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face, so you just have to look at it. And thats where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. Id say the cinematography is on par with Drive and/or Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the D Ps work. He did a really great job. More than anything though, this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didnt want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me  playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And thats just something you dont get every day. Very rarely am I awe stricken by a movie, and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year, and upon just one viewing, one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.",False
"Proof that you can follow up a blockbuster with another good film Globalization is one of those catchy buzzwords that shares the stage with the likes of abortion, and  capital punishment while one group of people thinks it is a good thing that just might save the world, another thinks it is on par with the plague.  There is however no dispute that with advancements in technology and the search for new capital markets, businesses are expanding abroad at a phenomenal rate into countries with little infrastructure or wealth and the everpresent danger of war.  This expansion has also been the catalyst for a lucrative sideline business  kidnapping.Peter Bowman is a man trying to do the right thing.  In order to build a dam to stop the killer floods in the South American country of Teclac he must work under the auspices of a large oil concern.  As with any overseas project, Peter has to deal with many problems: lack of supplies, red tape, feelings of isolation, a crumbling marriage and living with the threat of terrorist activity.  While on his way to work Terry is stopped at a roadblock and taken hostage by a band of guerrillas who demand a huge ransom for his release.  Enter Terry Thorne, an insurance investigator whose specialty is K and R  kidnapping and ransom.  Terrys job is to negotiate the release of kidnapped foreign nationals.  And he is a very busy man.This movie really piqued my interest and not because of the offscreen romance between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe: the father of a good friend of mine is an international financial consultant, and he was almost kidnapped while working in South East Asia.  The attempt was foiled by the quick actions of the special security detail that intercepted details of the plan and whisked him out of the country.   I spoke with him after seeing the trailers for the movie and he said that in country he is currently working in you do not anywhere without heavily armed escorts.  The possibility of being kidnapped is viewed as the cost of doing business.   I forgot to ask him if they had the appropriate insurance.Proof of Life grew out of a story in Vanity Fair and is loosely based on the kidnapping of an American businessman by Colombian guerillas. Taylor Hackford is a director who eschews the safety of studios, and opts for that extra touch of realism.  In keeping with this goal, he took the cast and crew down to Ecuador, where he was met with erupting volcanoes, blizzards, a cast beset with altitude sickness, a coup in Quito, muggings, heart attacks on the set and the death of a standin.   The final cut is an apt homage to those involved.Typically cast as the funny, quirky, girlfriend afflicted with endless minicrises, Meg Ryan has been afforded few opportunities to demonstrate acting abilities.  As Alice Bowman, she has the chance to flesh out a multidimensional character that doesnt spend her onscreen time whining, crying or laughing insipidly.  And she does so admirably.  Russell Crowe, riding high after the success of Gladiator, once again delivers a solid performance.  Crowe draws heavily on his own quiet, severe introspection to create a character conflicted between loyalties, expectations and realities and the feelings he tries to suppress for Ryans character.  Their real life tryst helped to establish the tone for  the powerful, yet subtle scenes they share onscreen.  David Morse is excellent as Terry, a man trying to hang onto his sanity in an insane situation.  As he is marched across country, and endures humiliation, and beatings, he never loses sight of his goal to stay alive and escape.  His transformation from clean cut businessman (Ive never seen him with such a close shave) to disheveled captive is done slowly and deliberately, and the viewer appreciates what hes experiencing. Finally, it was interesting to see David Caruso  who has floated in the acting netherworld since he left NYPD Blue almost six years ago  as a rival K&R specialist who assists Terry with his mission.  Caruso reminds us why he has not graced many marquees   hes not very funny, action is not his forte, and he is an average actor at best.  The other star of the film is the location.With most of the film having been shot in the mountains of Ecuador, (the guerrillas camp was literally carved out of the jungle) it is not surprising that the film looks gorgeous: tumbling waterfalls, plunging ravines and flourishing jungles are stock backdrops for the story and you begin to take them for granted.  One of my favorite scenes was when the infinite expanse of greenery is broken by a band of camouflaged rebels who were totally invisible only moments earlier.  I was surprised how tight the cinematography was given the expansive vistas, but nothing is sacrificed in the process.  In addition to a wellwritten script that avoids most cliches, and contains palpable suspense, I was impressed with the way the relationship between Alice and Terry was handled.  Rather than have the characters jumping into bed for a sweatfest the writers opted for an undercurrent of subtle tension with the characters exchanging occasional confused glances and moments of awkward silence when their hands brush.The first entertaining intelligent film to come out of Tinseltown in a long while  maybe it bodes well for the Christmas rush.",False
"Good story. Interesting and mostly believable in presentation.The Duchess  Set at the end of the eighteenth century, The Duchess is based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish (Kiera Knightley), Duchess of Devonshire. The film delves into Georgianas passionate and doomed affair with Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister, and the complex love triangle with her husband (Ralph Fiennes) and Georgianas best friend, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell).Kiera Knightley again does a period piece and again looks mostly out of place. Shes British alright, but a few stone away from looking like she belongs in 1770s Britain. Its augmented by the fact that her character, based on a real woman, was supposed to have gone through about 6 pregnancies, 4 of them successful. Knightleys emaciated form is just wrong. What is right though, is her performance. As a mother, as a chasismatic political presence and a woman desperate for a happy life she nails it absolutely.I could have seen a little less focus on the love triangle and a little more on the hows and whys of this woman becoming such an important and popular cultural icon in British society. The film glosses over how this came to be, and asks us to take it as a fact after one brief scene showing the Duchesss political shrewdness. Its another case of Hollywood ignoring whats different about a film, preferring the safety of delivering what people have seen before.Fiennes gives such a quiet performance right from the start but it grows and fills the area. Its often a mesmerizing performance because of his rigid adherence to societies expectations and rules at the cost of all else. Fiennes occupies the screen whenever hes in a scene. When he and the Duchess argue, shes like water smashing up against the unyielding cliff. Ralph Fiennes is awinspiringly scary in one scene without seeming in anyway over the top or demonizing of what his character represents. Ultimately his character is human and believable; purely a man of his times. His character is so down to earth and in the end simple. All he wanted from his marriage was a son and to be left alone to play with his dogs.A mesmerizing turn from Fiennes in a likable, if familiar film, The Duchess gets a B+",True
"Really good film!!I was surprised at how much I liked this film, I guess that I could somehow relate to the characters.  Mastersons Joon is an awfully sad character that I really felt bad for, so was Depps Sam, but they worked so well together, and had so many wonderful moments that made this film work.  Anyone with a heart will enjoy this sweet little film.  The only mistake was the relationship between Aidan Quinn and Julianne Moore, that just didnt seem to fit into the rest of the movie.  Still, its a sweet and warm hearted film that everyone should enjoy.  My rating: 8/10.",False
"The enigma is overpowering me I would not want to be the person shopping around a serious script in Hollywood about the life of the famous pianist Liberace. It would be the toughest of sells to a culture that would likely feel the material is too dry and the demand too little. A slightly campier script, with luxurious set design and intimate portrayals of characters the public wouldnt likely know about is what Id like to get my hands on. The story of Liberace is stranger than fiction and dryer, more serious material couldve corrupted its overall goals and ambitions.The film with the campier script, luxurious set designs, and intimate portrayals is Steven Soderberghs Behind the Candelabra, a wonderful, limitless look at the life of Liberace, an enigma in every sense of the word. In addition to playing many soldout shows, the man had a lovelife like no other at the time, meeting and becoming fast friends with Scott Thorson, an aspiring veterinarian who was quickly made his lover. Thorson seemed to have a genuine understanding of the loneliness and lack of friendship Liberace had and provided him with great talks, great compassion, and great sex.The relationship, however, resulted in drug addiction, intense plastic surgery, lies, mistrust, and ended with a lawsuit. Soderbergh and writer Richard La Gravenese dont hesitate to explore this and make it one of the deepest focuses in the picture. The relationships the men had had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. The scenes when they are together in a hot tub are human and romantic. The scenes when they are fighting are heartbreaking because you realize that these men havent just come so far to make their relationship work but losing each other after so long would be detrimental to their selfesteems and egos. They complete each other and thats where the magic is at its strongest.Liberace is played by Michael Douglas in one of the bravest roles of his career. So brave and powerful that its unfortunate that because of the films TV movie status it is ineligible for an Academy Award nomination. Douglas is an actor who is never conventional with his role choice. The same man who played a commonman pushed off a cliff of sanity, an executive victim to a consuming, reallife game, and a worried father of a drugaddicted daughter is the same man playing a middleaged, flamboyant pianist with a love for wonder, music, and men. The diversity in role choice is stunning.Matt Damon appears at his youngest as Liberaces lover Scott, in an equally conflicted, complex performance. Damon fills the shoes of the role beautifully and effectively, giving off much in the way of creative energy and heart as he shows just how stressed and torn Thorson mustve been in a relationship with someone who truly loved and understood him but wanted to manipulate him. Supporting performances from Rob Lowe as Liberaces doctor, prescribing medicines to both him and Thorson and Dan Aykroyd as his manager are terrific and often are seen providing strong comic relief.For a TV movie to have the cinematography and atmosphere that Behind the Candelabra does is truly a feature worth nothing. It may not be as excessive as Baz Luhrmanns Great Gatsby  I dont expect anything of the next two years to be on par with that film  but rarely has a TV movie achieved such phenomenally vibrant and luscious standards. The only thing that could make it better is Soderbergh proving he knows how to work with it and he most certainly does.HBO seems to be the goto network for biographical films about figures that wouldnt likely make appropriate return in the theaters (Behind the Candelabra especially considering the summer movie season has already hit the ground running). David Mamet, just a few months ago, directed the delightful and shockingly unbiased Phil Spector, with actors like Al Pacino and Helen Mirren receiving topbilling. Seeing as a Liberace biopic is directed by none other than Soderbergh, I wouldnt be surprised at seeing a slew of films about eclectic media figures being made and released on HBO in the next few years. Networks that have the drive and willingness to air these kinds of films are a necessity to the success of film.Starring: Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Rob Lowe, and Dan Aykroyd.

"Well done Watching this its easy to believe its an independent film, but I was surprised and impressed to learn it was also a first film for the producer, writer and director. The production values were very high, the casting was spot on, the direction was excellent, the music moved with the story, and the story telling was terrific. Hard to believe that the director couldnt legally drink at the postproduction party because he was still under 21.There are at least four major stories happening at once, each centered around one of four college friends who are back home in Palo Alto for Thanksgiving break. Other subplots and sideplots figure in, generally offering more meat than filler.My only question was how these four guys actually came to be friends. High school tends not to be a very egalitarian environment, and it seemed to me that these four fellows might not have had enough in common in high school to be this close after a little college time.Still, the individual stories were all true to life, not overly complex (which would have been inappropriate for the age of the characters), and interesting. Living in Palo Alto, part of me wishes the locale could have figured into the stories a tiny bit more, but thats a minor quibble. Not only do I recommend this (more of a guy flick than a chick flick), but Ill definitely watch it again. Well done, you firsttimers!",False
"A haunting tale about how nothing is ever as it seems On the surface, this is simply the story of a small Canadian town traumatized by a school bus crash.  Personal injury lawyer Ian Holm arrives on the scene in his expensive car, cellular phone at hand, ready to sign up victims for a lawsuit because, I believe there is no such thing as an accident.  But that summary really tells nothing, because this haunting tale is not about a grasping lawyer or greedy victims, but about how nothing is ever as it seems on the surface.Director Atom Egoyan does a remarkable job with the narrative.  Though at times the movie is difficult to follow because of some sequences which it is not immediately clear are flashbacks, its worth sticking with it.  The story works precisely because the chronology is chopped up to reveal the secrets each character, including the lawyer, keeps hidden, until the tragedy finally rips open the lives of everyone it touches.Repeat viewings are definitely in order, if only because of the multiple, interwoven layers and images which are not always apparent on first viewing, and to ponder the interplay among the three strands of narrative in the movie.  The movie is worthwhile, too, for Holms portrayal of his grim, relentless character (possibly the best of his career), and Sarah Polleys remarkable performance as a kind of modernday Greek chorus.",False
"the dreams in which Im dying are the best Ive ever had Harvey meets The Mothman Prophecies, as a troubled teen starts hallucinating a horrific 6foottall bunny rabbit that brings him dark forebodings about death and disaster in the very near future.  A streak of Heathers is mixed in as well, with trenchant satirical observations of highschool life in the late 80s (story set in Oct. 1988), involving a priggish teacher, a selfhelp guru (Patrick Swayze!), and a putupon fat girl at the fringes of the herd.  Finally, a whiff of Back to the Future, in the form of a local eccentric who just may have discovered the secret of time travel, but a secret that has more to do with spirituality than technology.   A lot goes on here.  Theres a meditation on the possible overlap between madness and the ability to perceive the divine.  Theres a demonstration of why, in the Bible, angelic messengers (if thats what Frank can be taken to be) are often so terrifying that they have to start by saying Fear not. Theres an enlistment of what martial artists refer to as the ki (or personal energy, emanating from a persons midsection) in the type of time travel depicted here (the term ki is never used in the flick, but the term path, another word for Tao or Way, is).  Quantum physics theory about wormholes is tied to the Fortean phenomenon of things falling unexplained from the sky, in a way thats more pivotal, and therefore more interesting, than the gratuitous rain of frogs in Magnolia.     Time travel paradoxes and ironies enter the picture as well.  One character (no spoiler!), whose life is saved by Donnies ultimate trip back in time, wouldnt have died in the first place if he hadnt dragged her along to the opening of the wormhole.  Another character (again, no spoiler!), whose truly terrible secret comes to light in the wake of an arson investigation, must go unexposed as a result of that same time reversal, since the arson now wont happen.  Surely thats no oversight on the part of the screenwriter; it must be an acknowledgment of the choices and tradeoffs in life, as well as of a confidence that no such terrible secret can remain hidden forever.     Somehow this pastiche works, largely on the strength of good performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal is appropriately moody and, also appropriately, not always likeable in the title role.  Drew Barrymore, who executive produced, appears as a frustrated firstyear teacher.  The movies often dreamlike atmosphere is enhanced by the cinematography, the subdued but effective special effects, and the choice of the music on the soundtrack, which includes 80s pop tunes, of course, and a haunting original song (over the end credits) titled Mad World.   Not for all tastes, but better, stranger, and more complex than I expected.",True
"Heat is a masterpiece In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out.  But not in the usual comicbook style of most films today.  Heat carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life youve lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a hearttoheart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliant camerawork have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering who could be so lucky to work with them?.

"I waited 1 hour 47 minutes ... for that?Without a doubt, one of the most idiotic films I have ever accidentally watched. It was like eating a lovely chocolate cake, then finding it hollow and full of cardboard as one dug deeper, then finding a dog turd at the centre of it.This director, Mike Cahill, desperately wants to be Shane Carruth (creator of the brilliant films Primer and Upstream Color).He isnt.There were so many points throughout this film where I nearly turned it off, but the Ambient Piano Montage style  completely derivative, and ripped off from Carruths films and others  kept me believing it had a punchline.It didnt.I tried hard to follow the science  I have a heavy computerscience and physics background, professionally, and Ive always been fascinated by evolutionary biology, especially molecular genetics. I was sure there was a core there of something: a something that would transcend the pseudoscience gobbledegook and liberate this film into brilliance.There wasnt.And finally, as it got very close to the end, I prayed  oh yes I prayed, to the gods of Auteurship  that they would not bring all this mumboid jumboid rubbish to bear, forcing the main character into a completely, literally impossible impasse.

"This movie is good but in a weird way.I recently watched Im not there and this movie isnt done in a way that really makes sense sometimes or flows, but after the first 10 minutes you really understand what is happening.This movie has different stories from different characters that come in and different times, and they all have something to do with bob Dylans life.I thought the movie was gonna show one story at a time, but they show one for like 5 minutes then another one and comeback to it later and sometimes only show a clip for it for a few seconds.This is done in a very arthouse style and is for fans of the genre, it isnt abstract crap like some movies but actually has some great scenes that are visually wonderful.Some scenes play like Fellinis 81/2 and this movie feels like a foreign film a lot of the time but the characters speak English.This movie is far from perfect for my taste and I am not a huge Dylan fan but I respect him a lot, the movie pretty much does a good job at pulling you into it and you go for a ride.Its well made and the acting is good all around, dont watch the movie if you dont like art type films or movies that focus on characters and out of place scenes that are put there for a visual purpose.Its a cool flick and I think a lot of people can respect it, its nice to see something original and not in some movie formula like a lot of Hollywood blockbusters we get these days.",False
"Typical TV Biography This film biography of 1950s Hollywood legend James Dean highlights his public life and the estranged relationship that he had with his father. Other aspects of his private life are merely hinted at, probably because to cover them honestly and forthrightly might have alienated some TV viewers. And so, the cinematic result here is shallow and superficial.The film stars James Franco, as Dean. Most viewers adore Francos performance. Certainly, he has Deans mannerisms down pat. Franco does a good imitation of Dean. But Francos acting is a little too affecting, a little too shallow, to be persuasive, in my opinion. In addition, Franco seems too young and innocent, compared to the real James Dean, a person who looked older than his years, and more sophisticated.Actually, it is the secondary performances that lift the films overall acting quality. Edward Herrmann, Mark Rydell, and especially Michael Moriarty are terrific in their roles. Other secondary performances are also quite good.Despite a superficial, and sanitized, script, and despite Francos mannered performance, the film is mildly entertaining, thanks to great production design, realistic costumes, excellent film editing, and the acting in secondary roles. The photographic stills of Hollywood and Manhattan, when combined with the jazzy background music, add authenticity to the storys settings, and therefore depth and texture to the film.For viewers who know little or nothing about the real James Dean, this superficial flick is worth watching, with the proviso that the film touches only on the most obvious aspects of Deans life. A lot is left out. A longer, more indepth, script would have perhaps yielded a more realistic, and therefore satisfying, film.",False

"A Pair Of Talented Louts Total Eclipse is the story of the relationship between two men who definitely made their mark on French literature. Poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud have been compared to Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, but aside from being gay the pairs have little in common. Wilde is a universally recognized talent who had the misfortune to fall in love with a spoiled young aristocrat in Douglas who had some pretenses to literary talent. Douglas was spoiled, but both he and Wilde conducted themselves well in public.Verlaine and Rimbaud were a pair of talented louts as Total Eclipse shows us in graphic detail. Wilde married for conventions sake at the time and did have two sons and was a loving husband. His is a Victorian Brokeback Mountain story. Verlaine was a drunk and an abusive husband who regularly beat on his wife and child who was totally fascinated by young Rimbaud. He was ten years older than Rimbaud in real life, the film does make him seem a great deal older. He did read some of Rimbauds work as a teenage prodigy and sent for the country lad. You can feel sorry for Wilde and do in the films that tell his story. Verlaine as played by David Thewlis is a really hateful person, gay audiences cant work up any sympathy for him.However Rimbaud as played by Leonardo Di Caprio by look and talent makes you perfectly understand why Rimbaud became so obsessed with him. Verlaine was a political man, he was a supporter of the Paris Commune and was in fear of the police who would have loved to nail him on a morals charge if not on a political one. Rimbaud didnt have a political opinion in the world, he was a peasant kid from the Ardennes who partied hardy, drove Verlaine crazy and jealous, but both learned and fed off each other artistically. I found it interesting that Rimbaud and Verlaine flee to Great Britain of all places to be freer, the same place that in the next generation would persecute poor Oscar Wilde.Di Caprio and Thewlis play a couple of louts, but a fascinating pair of louts. Total Eclipse has both these guys eclipsing the supporting cast around them, that probably is the main weakness of the film. Still fans of both men shouldnt miss this film.",False

"Many more surprising developments than could be derived from synopsis. Very original plot and inexhaustible turns of events. Not as farfetched as assumed from description Saw this at the Rotterdam Film Festival (IFFR) 2017, where it was nominated for the Tiger Award (but not awarded). Very original plot, unusual developments and it got much more complicated than the synopsis on the IFFR website already hinted to. The unexpected turns of events seem inexhaustible, but as soon as you think youve seen them all, a new unexpected thing happens. It did not bother me that the original setup seemed a bit farfetched. It became still more surprising after the sister was shown that he filmed everything, that she nevertheless knowingly kept the camera intact. The whole sequence of developments was compelling and there was not a single boring moment. During the final Q&A, the director told he had ideas since a very long time about a movie that a someone makes for himself and not to show anyone else. He had a lot of friends telling about their private videos, out of which stories he got more ideas that were incorporated in this film. Second idea was pushing someone past the limit. Third idea was a confrontation with your background, your family and everything else that determines where you come from. Finally, as a side remark, I noticed the very original format for the final credits. It started as a blue Bmovie with a naked man and woman on a beach, suddenly changing into credits rolling by in an oldfashioned type cast. It was not obvious to everyone in the audience that this indeed were the final credits, until someone started an applause after which everyone got it that this was the end. It was a nice deviation from the seemingly endless credits that come after most movies, meticulously quoting everyone involved in the film making until the last caterer and chauffeur.",False
"Besides De Niro, a Disappointing Bore I was really looking forward to this. I thought this was going to be great. Robert De Niro, HBO, Michelle Pfeffier, a very interesting story about one of the most successful conmen in our country, how could this go wrong? Unfortunately, it does from the beginning. The problem with this movie is that the writing puts it down a path that is uninteresting. We dont learn much about Madolff, his family or why he got to where he is today. Instead, its a series of interviews Madolff has with a NY Times writer while in prison. The story is told in a mix of flash forwards and flashbacks, never developing much of a rhythm. I started getting bored with the slow dialogue and unfolding of scenes that really didnt tell me much at all. Hank Azaria plays a great villain, but why do we need to hear 10 minutes of a disgusting joke to get that point? Theres just no build up or conclusion. What we get is a man who knows what he did was wrong and keeping it from his unlikable family. I had no sympathy.

"A Sad, Innocent Film Foreshadowing an America That Never Became Im going to speak frankly.As a person who is by no means a leftist or a liberal, I found this film to be very moving. Most people who review the film I assume are liberals, so I guess I offer a different perspective. For me, this is a sad film. It is sad because the vision of America that the liberals Tracy and Hepburns characters have here just did not pan out. The moment when Poitiers character says you see yourself as a colored man, but I see myself as a man shows just what sort of society these people imagined we would have, and its tragic that history did not turn out that way. From the vantage point of 2017, race relations are worse than ever before. With SJ Ws, Affirmative Action, crime in the inner cities, antiwhite racism, immigration problems etc, the vision that race would no longer matter just simply did not pan out. As whites today this film can only make us sad. Its tragic. I almost wish things did turn out that way, that race in America could have become a nonfactor and that none of the crazy problems we face today exist, but they do. And so viewing this film in retrospect, it seems so innocent and naive in a tragic way. Beautifully filmed with a San Francisco location and a lovely soundtrack, this is by all means a tremendous film, and I probably like it a little more than snotty liberals who probably can find this or that reason to view this film which to me seems progressive as reactionary.",True
"Wonderful adaptation, but missing the satire of the book I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like The Phantom Menace, Ive had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen? rather than How entertaining is this film overall? I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so Ill never know how Id have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps Id have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic childrens movies, like The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins, are so successful partly because theyre so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most childrens movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which theyre based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a childrens book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of diehard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. Thats why its easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a twoandahalf hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I dont have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. Its as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, Adventures in Babysitting), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just dont. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor Mc Gonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but thats exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laidback. The kids who play Harrys two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of overthetop slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the childrens delayed reaction to a giant threeheaded dog they encounter and Harrys swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harrys caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School arent in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following Professor Mc Gonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffboxpoints were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskersfind no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nineandthreequarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isnt as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that Im blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowlings series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary muggle world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and youre left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something Ive never seen happen before, though I dont go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didnt have that problem, but, as I said, I wasnt really trying to get involved in the movies story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harrys anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if hes kicked out, hell go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesnt tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harrys adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isnt enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful childrens series, but it doesnt entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the books delights to the screen. In its current form, its almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowlings series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",False

"A Treat For The Eyes And Ears As is the case with many of these latterday horror movies, this is visually stunning. This one is particularly so, with beautiful colors, wild special effects, lavish sets and a handful of pretty women, led by Winona Ryder.It isnt all beauty; there are some horrific, bloody moments in here. Ive seen the film three times and the first two times was terrifying to me in parts. The last viewing wasnt as scary, but maybe I was distracted by seeing this on DVD for the first time, which enhanced the visuals and added some nice 5.1surround sound.At two hours and 10 minutes, its a bit long but there are very few lulls, if any. Gary Oldham gives his normal intense performance as Dracula and it never hurts to have Anthony Hopkins in the film. The only negative I found was Keannu Reeves, who sounds a bit wooden in his lines. Is it my imagination, or is he a terrible actor? Maybe its just his voice. Nonetheless, Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, Sadie Frost and Bill Campbell all give good support to this film which is a real feast for the senses.",False
"Im designed to feel slightly dissatisfied!I will be the first to announce that I was not a huge fan of the original film. While I thought that it was interesting to see as well as an untapped concept in Hollywood, I felt that the characters were too forced coupled with a very amateurish and repetitive moments. It was an average film that seemed to be lacking bits of the human element. It needed something more. At the time I couldnt put my finger on it, but after seeing Before Sunset, I could see what it was. Maturity. This may sound strange, but I felt that Jesse and Celine were too perfect in the first film. They lacked connectiveness to the average person. I couldnt see myself in this situation. Perhaps if I would have seen the original film in 1995 instead of a couple of years ago, it would have been closer, but I just couldnt capture the moment. In Before Sunset, I feel head over feet for both Jesse and Celine.They seemed to have grown and experienced a life that was all their own. They seemed more passionate, more powerful, and especially more human. From their first meeting in the bookstore until the finale in Celines apartment, I was fully immersed in their conversation. I wanted to know everything I could about both of them, and I did. I loved hearing about Celines passion for the environment, and Jesses distraught marriage. It brought these two characters out of the screen and into our lives. Whether it was a scripted story or if Hawke and Delpy were playing off each other, it worked. I witnessed in this film two people who were made for each other. It was more obvious in this film than in the prior outing. What made this film work on such a higher level than the first were the actors. They have grown and emerged as two important commodities in the Hollywood community. This is probably Hawkes greatest performance in years. His relaxed actions made us feel relaxed around him, yet quietly pushing for him to be closer to Celine. His pushy sexual advances seemed less forced and instead more like honest love. He looked and felt like a man that has been dreaming of this encounter all his life, and it finally happened. You could see the excitement in his eyes to see Delpy again. It was more than just acting, he put so much heart into this performance that it was clearly displayed for all to see. The same goes for Delpy. At the beginning of this film, I didnt like her character. She seemed rough and rigid around the edges, constantly giving off that feeling that she was harboring a secret that she didnt want Hawke to know. As her character grew in this film, I understood why. She had a different life after the encounter than Hawke did. While he still longed for Celine in his heart, he did move on. She longed for Jesse in her heart, and to this day could not find anyone to replace his purity. I loved Celine much more in the sequel because she kept us guessing. Did she remember their night together? Did she really loose her grandmother, or did she just not show up that day in Vienna? Was the song just for Jesse? So many questions left me wanting more and more and more. Finally, I would like to say that Linklater is growing with his films, and this was a crowning achievement for him. He powerfully and delicately built a sequel that was for superior than the original. He continued with a similar format as the first, but gave us stronger characters and another beautiful city. The language in this film is intense. Listen to the words that come from Ethan and Julie, they embody so much of our culture and our lives. There were moments when I felt they were speaking thoughts directly from my mind. Everything in this film was connected and worked to the fullest extent of cinematic possibility. Overall, this was a brilliant film. Linklater captured the essence of these two heartstruck people and proved that it could be filmed. This is one of the ultimate love stories that will remain on your minds far after the film is over. The intimate final lines will continually reverberate as the best ever in a movie. This was a huge step up from the original, and is one of the best films of the year. If you were not a fan of the Before Sunset, I suggest that you check this out. It is a mature film that explores the power of love in a way that no other Hollywood film could. I would not be surprised if we saw the title of this film in the Oscar celebration this year. Check out this film to hear social commentary of our lives, fall in love, and especially to see the beauty of Paris. Grade: ***** out of *****",True
"The Portrait of Immature Middle Aged People in Touristy New York City There is no doubt that Woody Allen wholeheartedly loves New York City, but his attempt to illustrate the city in a Fellinilike fashion results in making the city look touristy. Seemingly the film has influenced the younger generation of New York based filmmakers and even they have made homage to this film (i.e., Jim Jarmuschs Stranger than Paradise similarly consists of wellcomposed medium shots and has a resembling scene of four persons sitting in a theatre. Also, Spike Lees Shes Gotta Have It features analogous landscape montages and has an akin scene of the protagonist running to meet his lover). Ironically, these youngsters present the city in more genuine manners and give Allens Manhattan an obsolete look.Though the portrait of immature middleaged people who cant deal with their relationships might be real, who wants to see that? Especially, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) soliciting his former 17yearold lover Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) not to leave for London, after discovering his other relationship doesnt work, is unbearable to watch. All central characters, maybe except 17yearold Tracy, have the same typical Allenlike personas in their ways of thinking and behaving Allen might have a dictatorship as a director and it causes the lack of the characters diversity. The screenplay contains many cliches (i.e., Allens voiceover monologue on the opening montage to depict the city as a books Chapter One, several pseudointellectual lines such as Isaacs describing his friends as pseudointellectual garbage talking about existential reality, Isaacs line Trouble is my middle name after his prospective lover says shes troublesome, and so on). Cinematography by Gordon Willis is inappropriately beautiful; the gap between the aesthetic visual and the halfgrown content generates an uncompelling, halfway style.",True
"Did I see the same movie?This was a wonderful starmaking vehicle for Diana Ross but the worst thing that could have happened to the legend of Billie Holiday. Billie was big, bold, gutsy and full of life. Diana Ross plays her as a sweet aenimic victim. The look is great and the music, not bad, considering. But it has zero to do with Billie Holiday and it takes a lot of nerve to try and improve on the original.",False
"a serious channeling of Dostoyevsky via infidelity drama by Woody Allen Match Point is my favorite Americandirected film of 2005. Woody Allen, coming off of hitting his stride again with Melinda and Melinda, goes back to his darker, dramatic side, and makes a story that may seem a little familiar, though not to his discredit. Woody borrows (some may say steal) elements from Fyodor Dostoyevskys Crime and Punishment, one of the great novels of the 19th century (some may say ever written, I have read his work though not this yet), and transfuses it with subject matter that hes more than well acquainted with the relationship drama. But unlike Love and Death, which was Allens way of parodying the work of the author, this time he takes the work seriously, plunging the audience into the mind, conflicts, and outcome of the protagonist. That the performances by the actors involved, particularly the three main leads are top notch (Jonathan Rhys Myers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johnasson in one of her best) brings full blood and flesh to Woodys strong skeleton of a film.The story starts slow. Chris Wilton (Rhys Myers) is an Irishman in London, a tennis instructor who couldve gone pro. He meets Chloe (Mortimer) through her brother Tom (Matthew Goode) and they soon become close, close enough for marriage. Basically, he marries into an upperclass family where hes coaxed into becoming a businessman for the family. But during this he also meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a struggling American actress, whos engaged to Tom. One thing leads to another, yadayada, and Chris winds up in a big pickle as hes in a lovetriangle between Chloe and Nola. Allen handles this dilemma with a powerful precision, by building up the relationships Chris has with each girl, and how there is not unbelievability in the setups. Nola is sensible and intelligent, if not altogether, while Chloe is caring and decent, if maybe too picture perfect for Chris. The dynamics are setup so well, it leaves room for ample drama and suspense.Allen, who has also been a playwright for decades, knows the way people interact like so, and how not to rush the situations and use tact with delicate scenes. There is also the element of Opera, which Chris sees with Chloes family often, and the element of tennis. The analogies that both produce could possibly be very trite or cliché. Its not to say a couple of scenes are even cliché (ladies, you know youve seen quite a few movies with passionate kissing in the rain), but I even bought into those scenes. There is perhaps a certain manipulation that goes into these kinds of love stories, how much the audience can go with the inner conflict of our main character. But as the protagonist goes into a frame of mind that most may not be able to identify with, were still with him all the way. And, perhaps, its also because I love a good, solid infidelity story. Allen has here not only his best film in several years, but also likely his most suspenseful one.Those who may not go with the sympathies &/or empathy for the characters may not like the film as much. Some have even criticized minor gripes with the film, like Rhys Myerss unconvincing accent, or the overusage of Londons most famous landmarks. As an American, perhaps, I didnt mind certain things like these. When a filmmaker has this much trust in his script (and Woody, pushing 70 in making this, is not amateur), and has the right cast, it just takes off from there. To say I was on the edge of my seat through a good chunk of the third act is an understatement and, at the core, was even cathartic in a way. Its the kind of film I would love to tell more people about, even if they think Woody is washed up after years of arguably lessthangreat pictures. For some it might not even feel like a Woody Allen movie, that at times its a little slick. It still is, however the work of an artist reaching further into his grabbag with younger, exciting actors, and an interesting use of a (finally) new city.",True
"Disgusting, boring monument to selfish and neurotic romance I realize Im taking on an icon here, but honestly, this is the most disgustingly boring and overrated film to come out of the 1970s. It is unfortunate that the rather pathetic Woody Allen, an admittedly intelligent man who alas squanders his considerable talents, firmly believes that the cosmos revolves around his legendary neuroses. Even more unfortunate, is the fact that he has succeeded in persuading a large percentage of the Western world to agree with him. Frankly, it does not speak well of our culture.This (yawn) movie revolves around a pair of self absorbed lovers...a neurotic New York comedian, Alvy Singer (played by Woody) and a wouldbe singer, Annie Hall. The two, both in analysis, move in together so they can exchange tales of their professional, paid for navel gazing. I certainly wouldnt want to imply that it might be simply for the convenient sex. The rest of this so called neurotic romance is far too inconsequential to bother detailing here.Annie Hall is played by Diane Keaton, an actress who is actually very competent. Her movies are frequently not my favorite, though I did enjoy the cute Baby Boom. Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes, now of course quite dated, which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time. That classic comment of Woodys regarding sex, This is the most fun Ive had without laughing doesnt particularly impress me with its brilliance. Fear not, Shakespeare, Woody serves as no threat to you as master of the English language. It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.Annie Hall isnt the absolute worst movie Ive ever seen, but it really doesnt have much to recommend it. I normally adore romances, but neither one of these two selfish neurotics captured my sympathy or even remote interest. Furthermore, the supposed witty banter between the pair failed woefully to either entertain or amuse me. Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband (then boyfriend), we both sincerely wished wed found some paint and watched it dry instead. I guess this intellectual comedy was just far too complicated for little old us to appreciate.",False
"Unbelievably overhyped, incredibly selfindulgent I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival and hated it. There is no plot or character development to speak of. There is beautiful scenery and some very lovely camera shots, but the camera frequently lingers for 5 or 10 minutes at a time, circling around the object of its attention, without any dialogue at all. I understand that there were only about 100 camera shots in the entire film. It was reminiscent of Blowup in some ways, but without as much interest. Im sure its an important film from the directors point of view, but the audience seems to have been entirely ignored. Of the 2530 people I talked to about it, one liked it and the rest hated it.",True
"Tour De Force!The controversial film from Korean master Chanwook Park evokes the sexiness of Abdellatif Kechiches Blue is the Warmest Colour and Parks own signature violence and thrills. Set in the 1930s Japanese occupied Korea, its a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Taeri) who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Minhee Kim). However, she must manage to convince the heiress to marry a conman (Jungwoo Ha) who poses as a count, for which she will get a chance for a better life. She gets into a moral dilemma when she starts developing feelings for the heiress.The Handmaiden is a triumph on every level. The film is divided into three chapters, all giving different perspective. This way, the story is perfectly structured to give more and more insight as the film progresses, but at the same time, keep the viewers guessing. It offers a few surprises along the way as well. Visually, its a feast for the eyes. The term every frame a painting gets overused, but it really fits here. Im not only talking about cinematography, which offered plenty of memorable shots and beautiful scenery, but the costume and set design. The three leads all gave terrific performances. Musical score by Yeongwook evokes, or better said, amplifies the emotions and the suspenseful tone. Despite the run time of 2 hours and 24 minutes, it never gets dull, its very evenly paced throughout. I couldnt look away for a second.One thing needs to be addressed, the film is quite explicit. That being said, it never gets vulgar, the sex scenes are done in perfect taste, they never feel out of place and theyre not there just for the sake of it. The relationship between the characters and the physical presentation of it are integral to the film. Its a film about passion, abuse, jealousy, betrayal and deception, but most of all, its an atypical love story, which will make one love and hate the protagonists at the same time. Its original and daring work of art that will stick with viewers long after its finished.Whenever Chanwook Park makes a film, it must undoubtedly be compared to his masterpiece, Oldboy. I dont think that The Handmaiden surpasses it, but it comes very close. With this film, he proved himself to be one of the greatest working directors today. Its the best film Ive seen this year, one that I cant wait to revisit. Its not to be missed.",True
"A small, but very affective watch.James Grays latest film tells the tale of Leonard Kraditor (Joaquin Phoenix), a man who had a problematic breakup with his fiancée two years ago, and has since been heading down a suicidal road. 4months into living back home with his anxious parents (played by Moni Moshonov and Isabella Rossellini) and helping out at his fathers drycleaning business, Leonard is introduced to Sandra (Vinessa Shaw), a sweet daughter of his fathers business friend. Wearing her heart on her sleeve, Leonard has moments of true spark with her, and you can see his eyes changing away from the torment inside. A woman is surely the right thing for Leonard, as he carves through the days with a wornout heart and a mind in loneliness. Soon after meeting Sandra, he befriends Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful but messedup girl thats dating her married boss (played by Elias Koteas). With her, Leonard sees an escape, and a burning romance. Leonards mind is now set on two women, and he finds himself torn between them.James Gray hadnt really impressed me with his earlier films, for me they all lacked out on the intensity and became standard crimethrillers. With his latest melodramatic romance, he really surprised me; he does a caring job directing the three performers, and he tells a strange and tender story. The music of the film is Jewish guitarinstrumentals that are carefully intertwined, but most of the film has got a blanket of quiet bleakness, and its covering every little corner.The performances of Gwyneth Paltrow and Vinessa Shaw are great, and although the two never share screenspace, director Gray naturally and carefully shifts between the two lives Leonard is living, and so the two of them add lovely pieces to the story. But its inbetween the double relationship the film and its protagonist is living, the film has to connect, and it couldnt have been done better than by Joaquin Phoenix. Leonard is a suicidal depressive that enters humanbounding and the give & receive of it, and this is a very difficult character to portray  but just look at Phoenix, he is phenomenal; the incredible naturalism of it shows Phoenix in the performance of his career.The melancholy of the film doesnt make it for the dominant audience, but Ive never even cared a bit for that, and its a delight that romance on screen can be thrown upon like this. Two Lovers is a small film with a heart thats full of rare atmosphere, the form of it is tearing and in center, a superb Joaquin Phoenix.",True
"I am stuck Beautiful, tender as flower and  light in terms of Hanekes style  I expected it to be hard & taught. Movie appeared to be the life story of few generations that are stuck in life. Somebody succeeds to leave successfully, somebody  not. Those who stuck do not suffer  they just lead the regular life  betray wife, indulge in sexual experiments, fight with spoiled kids, try to help refugees, solve probs at work & at home  regular lifetime routine. In some moments boring (by the way, as our everyday life) and in some extremely beautiful as the sea, movie is calm, tranquil and spectacular. We are all stuck and its up to us to decide which direction to go  to go in or to go out. 
I would like to write about last episodes of the movie: touching, deep, white, bright sea and the seaside are reminding me Marcelle Proust and Balbec times of his novel...One can watch and be bored from the watching but, probably, this is exactly the effect Haneke is aiming to achieve.",True
"I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher, but above all, I am a man, just like you Paul Thomas Anderson has grown as perhaps the greatest American auteur of his generation. At 42, this is his 6th film (following 1996s Hard Eight, 1997s Boogie Nights, 1999s Magnolia  my alltime favorite , 2002s Punch Drunk Love, and 2007s There Will Be Blood). Like the late master Kubrick and the aging master Terrence Malick (who, coincidentally, just debuted his 6th film, To the Wonder, at the latest Venice Film Festival where PTA won the Silver Lion for Best Director), he isnt the most prolific of filmmakers; but his perfectionist creations, cerebral yet strikingly cinematic and emotional, always leave an indelible mark (polarizing audiences but usually earning critical acclaim). The Master is no exception. Shot on 70mm film, it is not so much of an outside epic as youd imagine  although every single image is stunning and perfectly composed (courtesy of cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr., who replaced Robert Elswit, Andersons usual collaborator). It closely resembles There Will Be Blood in tone and content, but it stands on its own (Jonny Greenwood is once again responsible for the score).Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is a troubled and troubling drifter who becomes the righthand man of Lancaster Dodd (actor extraordinaire Philip Seymour Hoffman), the master of a cult named The Cause in post WWII America. Their strange, ambiguous relationship is the center of the film. The Master is a thoughtprovoking indictment of cult fanaticism and lies sold as religion, which has caused controversy and concern among Scientologists even before its release. By not mentioning real names, Anderson is capable of broadening the scope of his story and making it richer  and subtler  than a straightforward Scientology flick would have been. Like his previous films, theres more than meets the eye at a single viewing, and his attention to detail pays off (theres also a visual homage to Jonathan Demmes Melvin and Howard, another favorite of Andersons, in a motorcycle racing scene). Hoffman is as good as ever, and Amy Adams is highly effective (slowly depriving herself of cutesy mannerisms) as his wife. David Lynchs golden girl Laura Dern has a small role as well. But this is Joaquin Phoenixs hour, all the way. River Phoenixs younger brother has become a fascinating actor himself since Gus Van Sants dark comedy To Die For (1995), and, after his much publicized retirement from acting and music career hoax in 2009, he managed to come back with a performance for the ages, which shall culminate in Oscar gold. As for Anderson, it is unsure whether the Academy will finally recognize him as he deserves. His films may still be too outlandish for the Academys taste (hes announced his next project will be an adaptation of Thomas Pynchons crime novel Inherent Vice, a seemingly less ambitious project he hopes to make in less than five years). Regardless of Oscar numbers, we can rest assured that in a world where PTA gets to make such personal and original work and find his audience, there is still hope, and room, for intelligent filmmaking.",True
"Absolutely fantastic!I saw this film last night at a free showing and was completely blown away. I didnt expect it to be anything more than a clichéd murder story. How wrong I was! The story moves along at a gripping pace, the cinematography is beautiful (simple and complex simultaneously. A perfect balance.) The acting is very believable. I think anyone would enjoy this film, as the audience I saw it with was a mixture of people from a number of different socioeconomic backgrounds and everyone seemed to like what they saw. The only aspect of the film that worries me is that the main character is going to be viewed as a sort of embodiment of an angry, man hating feminist, rather than a girl who is on a mission to erase the horrors of pedophilia. The people I saw it with agreed that they were nervous that the film will only reinforce cultural attitudes about feminist as man hating, psycho bitches, which is simply a generalization. But remove that possible attitude towards the film and it is quite good. I really enjoyed it. Thumbs up.",False

The story is simple and meandering...but it works, and works incredibly well. Another Year will not be to the taste of the young kickcutting action packed generation.

"One Of The Most Engrossing, Mesmerizing & Satisfying Films Of 2014Winner of the prestigious Palme d Or at 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Winter Sleep arrives with high expectations but succeeds amazingly well in living up to its newfound honour for this Turkish drama is simply one of the most engrossing, mesmerizing & satisfying narratives to surface on the silver screen in the past year, and is definitely one of the best films of 2014.Set in Anatolia, the story of Winter Sleep concerns Aydın; the wealthy owner of a mountaintop hotel who was once an actor but has since fallen into the hibernation mode over the years. The plot covers the chaos his selfinvolved persona brings to his small kingdom as the animosity of his loved ones & the poor people under his reign begins surfacing once the winter approaches.Directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, the film takes a very methodical, patient & firm approach with its narrative which does a stellar job in slowly unraveling the inner details of the various characters inhabiting this story. The entire story is an amalgamation of one conversation after another but its how each discussion begins & ends plus seamlessly switches from one to another that makes it such an immersive experience.The locations are wonderfully chosen, set pieces are finely detailed, the hotel itself creates a calm but secluded ambiance which becomes all the more suffocating on the advent of winter. Camerawork is mostly still yet effective plus the landscapes are beautifully photographed, its 196 minutes of runtime never really bothers for the most part, thanks to its breezy storytelling & the score makes its presence felt just when its required.Coming to the performances, every single actor here chips in strongly in their given roles & leave nothing to complain about. Haluk Bilginer delivers a magnificent performance as Aydın, and is brilliantly supported by Demet Akbağ & Melisa Sözen who play his sister & wife, respectively. The rest of the cast also shines since each character is deftly scripted & gradually developed which differentiates them from caricatures.On an overall scale, Winter Sleep is an intensely gripping, masterfully told & exquisitely layered study of a selfrighteous character that also takes an interesting look at failing relationships, old age regrets, class divides, and the morals of right & wrong. And despite its challenging runtime, dialoguedriven plot & slowburn narration, it manages to be a truly immersive & absorbing cinema thats worthy of your time & money. Highly recommended.",False
"Uh, Yeaaah, Peter...Whats Happening?...Theres something about a study of life in a `cubicle to which just about everyone can relate; at least everyone who has ever had to get up every day, go to work and punch a time clock, then go home and wait to do it all over again the next day.  In `Office Space, writer/director Mike Judge (the guy who gave us `Beavis and Butthead) captures the essence of the workaday world, in this case in an office setting, though it could be on any job anywhere, from the largest conglomerate to the smallest business concern; anywhere a `corporate structure is in place and employed.  The subtle humor of Judges vision is funny, and often downright hilarious, and all with very little exaggeration of the way things really are, from the weekly `motivational talks from the boss, to staff meetings, corporate `mission statements and the protocol of cover sheets and memos, all of which as portrayed here have a sterling ring of truth to them. 	The central character of Judges story is a guy named Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a software analyst for `Initech, who after working with a therapist finds himself in something of a transcendental state of mind, whereupon he divulges to a pair of consultants `efficiency experts sent in to streamline the companys operation that he does only about `fifteen minutes of real work a week, due to the very structure (or lack thereof) of the company itself.  And his refreshingly honest candor in outlining his job description soon has quite an unexpected effect on his life, as well as that of a couple of coworkers.  Judge perceptively expands the satire to encompass facets of Peters life outside the office, as well, which gives the audience even more with which to identify, like driving to work in bumper to bumper freeway traffic that has slowed to a stop in Peters lane while the cars in the next lane going flying by; and when he changes into THAT lane, IT comes to a standstill while the cars in the lane he just left start to whiz on by.  Its an application of Murphys Law that  while certainly nothing new works well within the context of this particular story, in which the humor is derived from emphasizing the annoying, mundane things that happen to us all on a daily basis.  Like getting in the shortest line at the supermarket and taking longer than anyone else to get checked out. 	Livingston gives a notable performance, giving Peter that sense of the `everyman whod like nothing better than to break free of the rigors of the 8 to 5 existence.  He brings an affable presence to the screen that perfectly communicates what Judge is attempting to say, and does it in such a way that it validates Peters being selected as `Champion of the Cause as it were.  Also turning in memorable performances are Stephen Root (a terrific character actor), as Milton, a guy whose very existence seems to be a study in suffering abuse and degradation; and Gary Cole, as Peters boss, Bill Lumbergh, whose impudent, laconic methods of intimidation, delivered in such a droll manner, make him the boss everybody loves to hate. 	The supporting cast includes Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, the waitress with a minimum of `flare who has trouble `expressing herself, according to her boss; Ajay Naidu (Samir); David Herman (Michael Bolton); Richard Riehle (Tom); Joe Bays (Dom); John C. Mc Ginley (Bob Slydell); Paul Wilson (Bob Porter) and Diedrich Bader (Lawrence).  Reminiscent of the world portrayed in the `Dilbert comic strip, `Office Space works because it effectively puts real people in real situations, and brings you into contact with some characters youre going to recognize; I guarantee that no matter what you do to live, thrive and survive, youve run into these people, worked for them, and alongside them.  Its a case of art reflecting reality, and to Judges credit hes succeeded in making a funny movie that really hits close to home, without resorting to any gross or infantile humor to do it.  Its a film that simply puts the `corporate experience in the spotlight and gives you a chance to laugh at `the boss, and maybe even a little bit at yourself along the way.

I went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and I must say, after the movie was over there was total silence in the theater.

"Compelling, but over the top To me this movie is both a relevant and compelling story, as well as a model of overcompensation. I feel as though Philadelphia was trying desperately to show a touching, human side to the AIDS epidemic, but at the same time overly conscious of the lack of compassion much of middle America has for homosexual victims of AIDS. As a result, our protagonist Andrew Beckett is made to be a virtual superman. I would have had more respect for the film if theyd made him more like you and me. If he had been a bright, successful lawyer with friends, a loving family, and a serious relationship that would have made him someone we could really relate to. Instead, Andrew was a legal phenom, THE rising star, future senior partner, the future leader of the law firm. And in his personal life, he was the most popular person at his firm, beloved by all. More than that, he was the most popular member of his whole family, he was brilliant, affable, going straight to the top, simply AMAZING!!! Doesnt it seem like they tried too hard to get us on his side? To show the human story of AIDS, show us an actual person, not superman. That is problem with Philadelphia.Having said that, Tom Hanks was fantastic, as usual. Denzel was also rock solid, his character basically representing all of us, the general public, the ones who dont empathize with gays because they either dont know any, or arent conscious they know any, and fail to appreciate that they are real people and not merely stereotypes. His enlightenment with regards to this is one aspect of the movie I felt they came through on exceptionally. Philadelphia was an important story to be told, for just like so many other human tragedies, for us the unaffected to be able to see just one example up close and personal, it carries so much more weight than all the news reports and statistics in the world. I hope it had some positive impact in creating compassion among the general public. I just wish the film makers hadnt felt it would be necessary to go to superhuman lengths to give us a character we could feel for.",True
"its a von Trier  so what do you expect I have already several years ago decided that Lars von Triers movies can neither be called good or bad, they are always different and thought provoking but most certainly also irritating and annoying. Manderlay is no exception.Our heroin spots a dictator on the axis of evil, storms in with light sabers and an everoptimistic smile, brushes away the dictator and her regime, and is proud of having brought freedom and democracy to yet another place (any similarities with other persons  living or dead  are fully intentional and of course debatable).But how do you make democracy work when people have not learned it through practice and the collective memory of democracys fallacies since the ancient Greek city states. How do you make people value their freedom and be responsible for their own fortune, when it is much more comfortable to blame someone else for their fate.Von Trier brilliantly and ironically discusses these issues with surprising twists in the plot. But he will most definitely offend all kinds of Americans who will be too rash to judge this movie as anything between a misunderstanding and an insult of the American people of whatever color.Bryce Dallas Howard (Grace) delivers a great performance.To make a movie on an almost naked stage with imaginary doors etc. is very different from anything else and it actually could contribute to focus more on the actors performance (as on a theater stage). But I think that the hasty cutting of scenes and the annoyingly shaky handheld camera actually diminish the actors chances of delivering a forceful performance. I dont mind the handheld camera of the Dogma movies, but this is no Dogma movie. It has artificial music, sound effects, lightning, requisites, etc. So why bother to have a handheld camera.Manderlay is an excellent movie for anybody who enjoys being provoked or how wants to confirm her/his prejudice about von Trier as a weird director with tendencies to be proudtobeold Europe.",True
"A gripping experience with complex themes I saw this film at a special screening in NYC on Tuesday. It is superb both in direction and acting. Both the sex and violent scenes are quick and direct. While the violence is quite graphic, as to be expected with Cronenberg, the camera does not linger on it at all. The real story is told through the emotional dynamics in the family as the plot unfolds. Mortensens performance as Tom Stall is brilliant and wonderfully nuanced and the entire cast is first rate. Maria Bello as the wife and Ashton Holmes as the son and Ed Harris as the heavy are spot on. William Hurts scene is a standout. There are moments in the film where you laugh and then are horrified within seconds. DC doesnt dumb down to the audience but enjoys the complexities of human reactions to issues of identity, violence and societys view of good versus bad violence. I still cant get this film out of my mind. Im definitely planning on seeing it again when it opens widely. Highly recommended.",False
"Bound to win Academy Award nominations  and rightly so In 1976, the rivalry between two brilliant racing car drivers, the British James Hunt and the Austrian Nikki Lauda, came to a head in the almost literally lifeanddeath struggle of the Formula One championship. American director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon) and British scriptwriter Peter Morgan (both play and screenplay of Frost/Nixon) have done a terrific job bringing the titanic struggle to the big screen, aided by some excellent casting and powerful sound and cinematography. Those were the days when most years a couple of drivers would be killed, so the stakes could not be higher.Sensibly the car racing does not overdominate, since this is essentially a character driven conflict, but when the racing is on screen  notably in the final race  the excitement is visceral. The Australian Chris Hemsworth (previously best known as Thor) and the Spanishborn German Daniel Brühl (Inglourious Basterds) are so good as the British and Austrian drivers respectively that the dialect coaches should receive a special commendation. Arguably Brühl gives the stronger performance which should auger well for his future career.A great strength of this tale is that there is not a hero or a villain. Both drivers had privileged backgrounds and were superbly talented, but both were flawed. although in very contrasting ways, including styles of thinking, driving and womanising (Olivia Wilde as model Suzy Miller and Alexandra Maria Lara as aristocratic Marlene Knaus respectively).I never saw the recent film Senna (2010) so Rush reminded me most of the much older Grand Prix (1966), but what is stunning about Rush is that it all happened. A season of the fastest sport in the world decided in the last race by one point  you couldnt make it up. Rush to see the movie.",False
"The Best of All Hollywood Biographies Chaplin is an incredible film about one of the most incredible and controversial icons in Hollywood history.  Robert Downey, Jr. is perfectly cast as Charlie Chaplin, and it is his brilliant performance which earned the Oscar nomination that he deserved and received.  Richard Attenborough did a masterful job directing this masterpiece of biographical films.  Two actors who are underrated for their performances are Paul Rhys (who played Sidney Chaplin), and Moria Kelly (who played both roles of Hetty Kelly and Oona O Neil Chaplin). Kevin Kline is amazing as Douglas Fairbanks.  There is one scene in the film where Douglas Fairbanks, knowing he is ill, looks at his reflection in a mirror on the bar.  That is one example of the symbolism throughout the film by director Richard Attenborough that is astonishing.  Robert Downey, Jr., plays off the great Sir Anthony Hopkins will ease.  It is a wonder that with all of his personal problems in his relatively young life that Robert Downey, Jr. doesnt appreciate the opportunities that have been handed to him.  There is incredible talent in this film  including a previously Oscarwinning director and actor (Attenborough and Hopkins, respectively) and a female actor who would win an Oscar for another film that same year of 1992 (Marisa Tomei).  Even Dan Aykroyd is almost overlooked as silent comedy filmmaker Mack Sennett.  Through Chaplin we realize that it was Mack Sennett who discovered Charlie Chaplin as well as other comedy greats at the beginning of Hollywood history.  Chaplin is underrated and sometimes underappreciated, but it is a brilliant film that should be considered a classic when the time is appropriate.",False
"Inspirational I have watched this movie 6 times now and Im still drawn into it each time. The main characters, Donald and Isabelle are wonderful. Each is dealing with aspergers syndrome, but I didnt find myself focusing on that aspect of their lives. What I saw was two human beings, both of them making difficult, out of character adjustments to better love and understand the other. Ive read some comments debating the authenticity of the characters and how they portray AS and autistic individuals, but the only comments that have mattered to me were those of Jerry Newport, whose story this movie was inspired by. He gives it his stamp of approval, so who is anyone to argue someones personal story? I give this movie my highest recommendation.",False
"Unbearable I have always wondered about people who give one star reviews. Is it for the extra attention? Is it a joke? Can a movie really deserve one star?Well finally I have seen a movie which simply does not permit me to give it any more than one star. A movie that has prompted me to create an IM Db account and write this review so that other cinema goers do not have to share the mind numbing agony of my experience. My woes stem from the fact that To the Wonder seems to be an experiment into expressing nothing but the emotions of love and loss. Initially this seems a noble cause, but it comes at the expense of plot, dialogue and even character development. So if you sit through the first 30 minutes thinking I wonder if anything is going to happen?, sadly the answer is no. There seems to be the assumption that an audience can share in the on screen emotion without ever being given access to the motivations and events which led to them. It is like watching The English Patient and trying to understand Ralph Fiennes emotional turmoil without being shown the flashbacks of his life before hospital. So without any narrative or dialogue, the poor actors are left trying to convey their emotions by looking gloomy (as Ben Affleck does for the entire movie) or by performing pirouettes and looking wistfully into glinting autumn sunshine (for Olga Kurylenko).If you are a huge fan of the back of Ben Afflecks head, youll love this movie. For me the only enjoyment was in the irony that a film about emotion should be so emotionally uninvolving. That and the joy of seeing the end credits finally roll, upon which I punched the air and shouted Yes! This is something I have never felt the need to do before in a cinema, and it certainly surprised my wife (who looked mortified). I didnt care. This film marked a new found level of tedium, so extreme that it should probably be reserved for Guantanamo Bay. One star tedium? You bet.",False
"All of Tarantinos works are amazing and this is definitely no exception Four of six ruthless criminals await for their boss at an abandoned warehouse. After finding the diamond heist that they had all teamed up to accomplish was a trap, they realize that one of them is a police informant.The movie is told through a series of flashbacks from each of the criminals. I have never seen this done so breathtakingly. Dogs is an absolute masterpiece. It may not be Tarantinos best but is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. There is absolutely nothing between the satirical writing or the hardtowatch murders that could possibly make the movie any more perfect. Overall, the movie is absolutely incredible and I do not wish to say anymore to give away any sense of the ending.I highly recommend this movie.",True
"Great Performances, But Only a Good Movie.Iris is an intense characterstudy that is full of bravura performances, but is also a film that struggles for greatness and never quite reaches the mark. Iris Murdoch was a great English novelist, arguably the greatest of her time, but Alzheimers would strike the writer and eventually take away everything needed to continue her literary work. The film splits in two between Murdochs early life (played by Oscarnominee Kate Winslet) and her latter life (Oscarnominee Judi Dench). What we see is Murdochs relationship with her true love and futurehusband John Bayley (Hugh Bonneville in the early sequences and Oscarwinner Jim Broadbent in the latter stages). Iris struggles as it goes back and forth between the early years and the latter years of Murdochs life. This makes the film like a jumpingjack that just does not know when to quit. The film is not complimentary to Murdoch in her early years as she is shown as a teasing bisexual who basically uses men and women for her own personal gain. She is also shown as a somewhat cruel person who intentionally and unintentionally hurts those closest to her. Dench, on the other hand, plays Murdoch as a woman slowly losing control of those things most important to her. There are definitely flashes and similarities between the four actors who play the two characters flawlessly. Broadbent is best, but his Oscar win is not dominant by any stretch of the imagination. The film also looks somewhat cheap and rushed at times. It is just so British and the production values are not near as high as they really should have been. However, the film does show the Alzheimers Disease in a very accurate way. Those who have seen it firsthand (I have) will find the film very difficult to get through because the research done for the movie is secondtonone. Those who are not familiar with the disease will find the film intriguing and interesting. Iris is a fine effort and the performances save the day on more than one occasion, but overall the film is not quite what the filmmakers had hoped it would be by the final act. 4 stars out of 5.",False
"Somersets World Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (This isnt going to be a happy ending) or Dantes Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the films final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophets particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the films astounding miseenscene, a disturbing filmnoir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roachinfested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Birdseyeview shots of downtown (the city is never named a generic, everymans kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the films closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.This is Somersets vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, filmnoir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first.",True
"Fight for Survival A man (Robert Redford) is sailing alone in his yacht but during the night, his vessel collides with a container adrift on the sea while he sleeps. The yacht is flooded and she loses her navigation and communication equipment and heads to a violent storm. When the yacht sinks, the sailor embarks in the liferaft that is carried adrift by the currents to a shipping lane. His fight for survival begins. All Is Lost tells the story of a skilled sailor fighting to survive stranded in the high sea. Robert Redford has stunning performance, the cinematography is impressive but the writer is lazy and should have researched more about navigation and lifesaving procedures. In addition, there is no character development and the viewer never knows what the man is doing in the Indian Ocean.Vessels have bilge pumps and EPIRB and pleasure yachts usually have also portable bilge pumps. Robert Redford is shaved all the time and never wears lifejacket or immersion suit or even a hat to protect from the sun, maybe because he is the star of the movie and needs to show his face. The inflatable liferaft does not seem to have the usual survival equipment and the sailor does not have a survival kit ready on board for emergency situations. But despite the flaws, All Is Lost is not a bad movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Até o Fim (Till the End)",True
"It Thinks It Means Well But It Really Doesnt A man and a woman take the stage here in 1972; the first, Billie Jean King, wins a tennis championship after a blurry match opens the titles; the second, Bobby Riggs, abandons his own family to gamble, often through his own tennis rounds. Right away, the men state how women are less publicly prevalent in tennis as men, meaning they get paid less as well. Sound familiar?Battle of the Sexes follows much truer to history than you may think —allowing the real Billie Jean to oversee the production process proves the clear effort made to create a strong 21st century female role model. In the end, a fair point comes across: we need to reconsider our gamble in life.The screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy (127 Hours, Slumdog Millionaire) still has potential for another future masterpiece based on his new display of wellcrafted dialogue, as his style here enables each individual to realistically talk around their lies in a clever fashion. You can sense the depth behind these conflicted words, as only whatever matters to everyones true values gets talked about.The cast too expresses a strong desire to communicate the message about women empowerment, as most of them put in the best they could give. Oscar winner Emma Stone (Birdman, La La Land) portrays Billie Jean King with confidence to match her preparation for the role. Steve Carell (The 40Year Old Virgin, Foxcatcher) portrays Billie Jeans ultimate rival with a considerable hardness that proves the comedians effectiveness at drama. But I most enjoyed one of the smaller roles, Natalie Morales, who plays Billie Jeans stuckup authoritative agent. Unfortunately, some of the male actors destroyed the perfect performance streak, particularly Austin Stowell, who plays Billie Jeans husband, and Alan Cumming, who plays a stereotypical British assistant thrown in mostly for comic relief. So sadly, not everyone in the cast and crew was truly passionate about its message of gender superiority.In fact, almost nobody of redeemable quality supports the messages potential positive value. In essence, we dont even meet Billie Jeans husband until the midway point, which ends up feeling extremely joyless since beforehand, we see her sexual attraction toward her lesbian hairdresser come out in a moment of embracing and unzipping in a dark, steamy motel room. At this rate, why would I want to see an unfaithful wife succeed in her desire for fame and fortune?As for Bobby, he appears to be nothing besides a depiction of the eras public mindset—an unmotivated woman hater. The balance in telling his story all throughout the feature is barely even there, as editor Pamela Martin (The Fighter, Little Miss Sunshine) leaves too long stretches of time away from Bobbys subplot. Even his climactic tennis match against the famed female star lacks any tension on his behalf, since no details are learned about what tennis means to either combatant.The directorial appearance in particular lacks any artistic quality, from Emma Stones fake black wig to needing to play Wheres Waldo on the screen. What do I mean by that? Well, the two directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) unintentionally make you search harder than necessary to find the character talking. Their lack of screen control plays its greatest toll in the end, when the legendary match is viewed from far away into the audience bleachers, consequently ruining the intimacy of tennis. The cinematographer, Linus Sandgren, just won the Oscar last year for his colorful live action daydream, La La Land, but now his Steadicam work takes a massive step back into dull indie movie mode.In the long run, the extreme preachiness may turn you off the most, since it forcefully tells you to accept its worldview on gender superiority. Similar to various feminist propaganda such as Thelma & Louise, Erin Brockovich, Frozen, Wonder Woman, and countless others, men are painted to look like the predators responsible for womens problems, which in this circumstance devalues heterosexual relationships and diminishes love to impulsive selfishness. Why do so many message films have to force such onesided, surfacey conclusions? These events may have actually happened, yet the depiction of her affair straight up degrades straight married people. Bobbys marriage appears problematic until his wife decides to change in a submissive fashion, while Billie Jeans sole roadblock in her newfound love is her current husband? Give me a break.Although my parents and I felt disappointed after walking out of the theater together, it led us into a rather indepth discussion about our current treatment towards the LGBTQ community. Therefore, we as viewers ought to talk about these crucial ideas more, as listening to one another will help us realize the true blinded difference between the sexes.",False
"A modern Epic Its true: Linklater took 12 years to develop his family of characters. While I was intimidated by the 3 hour run time, I have to admit, there was not a moment of this film I could have done without.This is more than a coming of age story; the title Family or Motherhood would be just as appropriate. Set in Texas, the screenplay is natural and reminiscent of plenty of Linklaters other work: a film that begins with dialog unlike any other Linklater films evolves into thoughtful, poignant discourse not unlike that from the Before series. One character in a latenight nacho scene was perhaps a callback to the heady Waking Life. With that said, this absolutely is not a mere think piece. What makes this film truly fantastic is how accessible the material is, given its scope. Without giving any narrative away, Ill say that the story itself is absolutely engaging and not without surprises. I watched many films at Sundance 2014 (including comedies), and this was the first that had the audience reacting throughout: we laughed, gasped, covered our eyes, and I am sure more than a few of us wept.The characters are well developed. Dont be fooled by the title  the spirit of Boyhood is alive here, but the female characters are thoroughly developed, distinct, and alive. Unfortunately, though its 2014, this is a rarity in cinema.Like in Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly, Linklater has again delivered true visual innovation. This time, however, his setup is simple: shooting on film, Linklater replaced rotoscoping with time lapse. Has a single film ever intentionally traced a character over such a span of time? Linklater wisely chose to reveal the main character to us subtly. Despite this, the effect is riveting.I am not exaggerating when I say that after I watched this film I sold all of my other tickets to Sundance films. Viewing Boyhood for the first time was such a joyful experience that I didnt want to tarnish the experience by any comparison. Everyone in the Eccles theater shared a special few hours together. Though this only premiered a few days ago, I am confident that this will go down as one of the most ambitious and rewarding film projects of our time.",True
"Believable and breathtaking view of rocknroll in the 70s.On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I gave Almost Famous a score of 95.One of the most critically acclaimed movie experiences of the year 2000, Almost Famous is the second feature film to come out Cameron Crowe, and he beats his first effort, Jerry Maguire by a mile. Almost Famous is a stunning, thoughtprovoking film that comes at you directly from the eye of the camera and hits you with a hard bang. Its a movie not only for people who love 70s rock bands, but for all moviegoers who really love the feeling of coming out of the cinema feeling totally fulfilled.A 15 year old boy named William Miller (Patrick Fugit) gets an opportunity to travel with a rock band, Stillwater on a 1973 tour. As a younger boy, his sister (Zooey Deschanel) and his widowed mother Elaine (Frances Mc Dormand) had fought about the mothers control over the family and her denial of rock music. The sister leaves home and leaves the young boy her record collection, which immediately seizes his attention. As a teen, he makes record reviews for an underground newspaper. He submits those to Creem magazine writer Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and gets his attention. The two become fast friends and Bangs acts as his mentor as Rolling Stone magazine comes calling. Slipping into an inner group connected with Stillwater, Rolling Stone agrees to bankroll him on a trip with the group. There he meets the Band Aids, a group of girls that refuse to be called groupies because they are dedicated only to specific bands. Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), the Band Aids leader is enamored with the group leader (Billy Crudup), but befriends the teen. He responds with complete infatuation with her, but he is equally enamored with the charismatic guitarist. While accepted by the band (other members are Jason Lee, John Fedevich and Mark Kozeleck), they nonetheless refer to him as the enemy  a rock critic.The film is classically cool and endlessly enjoyable, making it by far one of the top 5 movies of last year. The film boasts absolutely incredible performances, Patrick Fugit is a newcomer and has terrific potential, Frances Mc Dormand is emotionally stunning as an overprotective mother and Billy Crudup, who I underrated at first, gives a performance of believability and power. However, it comes as no surprise that the films acting star is Kate Hudson, daughter of Goldie Hawn. Hudson gives a masterful performance as Penny Lane, she pulls off all Lanes facial expressions effortlessly brilliantly, and God knows she is one of the most stunning young performers of her current time, and she gives one of the most memorably exciting performances of 2000. Cameron Crowe gets a big pat on the back too for arranging the movie delicately and with absolute dedication.Cameron Crowes instant classic is a hard one to beat, and is surely the closest thing we have to a perfect `rock movie these days.

want more danger Mona (Natalie Press) is hurt after getting dumped. Her brother Phil (Paddy Considine) is her only family. He is a reformed criminal and a bornagain Christian. He runs his congregation out of his pub. Mona befriends rich girl Tamsin (Emily Blunt) who is haunted by her sister Sadie who died from anorexia. The two girls friendship grows into a sexual relationship. Tamsin is furious at her father and his secretary who is cheating with him. Phil leads his congregation to plant a wooden cross on top of the hill. Tamsin starts flirting with him.These are three terrific young actors on the rise. This feels more like a bright breezy lesbian romance at first. It turns into something different but it never gets dark enough. The Tamsin character needs more chaos. It would help if they do something more dangerous. Its a movie of a manipulative female but the manipulations are more like emotional game playing.,False
"One of the better thrillers of the 90s I have wanted to see this movie for quite some time, and I finally saw it, and I thought that it was great. I am a huge Martin Scorsese fan, and I would have to say this is one of his most true to life films, even though its not his best film. The acting is great,and so is the music. The film will send shivers through your body. This is also one of De Niros most underrated performances and deserved more attention at the time of its release. Its also great to see some of the actors from the original version show up in cameo roles. If you like horror films and thrillers, you will most likely enjoy this. ***1/2 out of ****.

"Quietly gripping morality tale  a near perfect movie Saw this last night. Set at a Wall Street firm on the night in 2008 when the leaders realize that changes in the market will wipe them out if they dont immediately stop selling the products that have been making them all rich, the movie centers on the moral dilemma  recognized by some characters but dismissed by others  that they face in unwinding their positions, saving themselves but shifting the pain to others.The movie finds a way to hold the mirror up to our civilization, showing how we are all complicit in a collective dream (one character says at one point, in response to another who says he feels like he is in a dream, Funny, it seems like I just woke up). The dream is the illusion of easy, riskmanaged wealth that the financial markets manufacture, again and again, since the emergence of capital markets 200 years ago, until the illusion morphs overnight into a panic. Reality intervenes, fear takes over, and the survivor is the guy who first reaches the lifeboat. So there are no villains in this movie, just people, richly drawn, beautifully acted characters realized by some of our best actors who relish the opportunity to show what they can do given a killer script and enough screen time between lines to actually be the people they are portraying. Central to the movies success: 1) It gets across the essence of what is going on in the financial markets without bogging us down or dumbing it down2) finding a moral question that can be resolved in a night, yet which is nevertheless a perfect allegory for the whole set of moral questions raised by an economy that works the way ours does, rewarding false confidence, recklessness, and deceit as often as industry, skill, and integrity3) the placement of young, innocent but perceptive characters at the center of the drama, who function as our eyes and ears, who are like standins for all of us who werent there, at the heart of the dream machine, when the latest fantasy of easy wealth was exposed as a collective delusion4) really gets the trader ethos and manner  they are a kind of warrior caste, foulmouthed, impulsive, deeply selfish, surviving by their ability to outplay their counterparts, and yet living by a warrior code that sets boundaries on what they will and will not do to one another (having spent three years on Wall Street several panics ago, it rang as true as any movie I have seen on the subject)Its like Mamet, except you dont have to work as hard to figure out what everyones up to. Its like Chinatown, except the crime is something far worse than molesting a single young girl. These guys f****d the entire planet, for Ch*****sake. Its like the best movie Ive seen in a little while.What an incredibly sure hand from a director on his maiden voyage! Who is this guy? Whoever you are, please dont stop. I would pay a lot to see what he could do with topics like the decision to go to war, or the emergence of China/India/Brazil/Indonesia from poverty to global player. Hell I would go see him revive Mother Goose, after this debut.Ill calm down now. Enjoy.",True
"Absolutely heartwarming w/amazing performances.This movie I havent seen in years & yet I often think about it. It was one of those films you were sad to see end. Beyond just the excellent & original story is all of the brilliant performances by all. In a cast that was excellent all around including Tobey Mc Guire & Reese Witherspoon before either of them were big stars I have to give special props to Jeff Daniels & Joan Allen. I have yet to meet anyone that doesnt think this is an extremely good film. The way all of the characters interact is what makes this such a special film. I honestly dont know how this didnt make at least twice as much money as it did, because its that original. If you havent seen it, do yourself a favor & watch it & I dare you not to be impressed.

"Grubby film noir This novel adaptation was the second after a first movie in the 1940s. This one retains the period setting but ups the ante in terms of sexual content, featuring one of the most explicit sex scenes ever shown in a mainstream film which goes far further than any film before  or since.The plot is simple in the extreme: the wife of a Greek man who runs his own diner, bored and neglected by her husband, begins a torrid affair with a drifter her husband employs as his mechanic. From there on in, the story gradually develops in often fascinating ways as the two lovers realise that only one things stopping their happiness: her husband.The film is shot through with a grim and gritty emphasis, best realised by Nicholsons grubby mechanic. Hes nobodys idea of a sex symbol, although Jessica Lange is quite ravishing as the object of his attentions. This focus on realism over Hollywood fantasy is what makes the film so watchable and, in places, uncomfortable as it becomes clear that the lovers have something of a sadomasochistic relationship.Things move into courtroomdrama territory later on (featuring some terrific acting work from Michael Lerner as the lawyer) whilst handing a number of blinkandyoullmissem minor parts to familiar faces (John P. Ryan as a blackmailer, Angelica Houston as  bizarrely  a circus owner, cult favourite Don Calfa as a circus hand, Brion James as a thug and Christopher Lloyd as a salsman).I found the film to be sometimes compelling and never boring. Its one of those films you watch to find out just what happens to the central characters, a curiosity bolstered by the feeling that theyre never going to unentangle themselves from this mess. Come the surprise climax, well...youll have to see for yourself.",False
"A Nutshell Review: Promised Land Director Gus Van Sant reunites with actor Matt Damon once again after their award winning film Good Will Hunting, but this time with actor John Krasinski filling in for Ben Affleck as part of the writingacting equation in a film that combines a big bad natural gas mining corporation, sales pitches by its sales people and elements of environmental protection all rolled into one. The result is an engaging and reflective look at people who have to lie outright in order to do their jobs, or to rely on half truths repeated enough times to be convincingly real, and that prick of conscience should that day arise.Damon plays the lead role of Steve Butler, whose stellar track record of closing more land deals at rock bottom prices puts him in pole position for that cushy headquarters promotion, in a company that deals with natural gas mining, moving like a Juggernaut and buying up plenty of agricultural farm land that are sitting on valuable shoal. And the game plan used by Steve is deceptively simple – to position himself as one of the towns own, having grown up on a farm, and transforming himself from corporate bigwig wannabe, to the trusted neighbour down the street. All he has to do is to close another deal to move into the corporate boardroom, which would be a piece of cake, except for a school science teacher to derail his seemingly smooth plan, and getting the townsfolk to decide based on a majority vote. Written by Damon Krasinski, the story is a fairly interesting one that takes on both a macro look at the problem at hand, where clean energy sources may not be as clean as its made out to be, especially in the exploiting process, while on the micro level, has plenty of carefully crafted characters to carry the narrative through. For those of us who do not understand the environmental impact of wasteful clean energy production, this film has enough time dedicated so that youll gather the gist of it, then use new information against what Steve has to present, in the name of very real corporate offers thats one time only, with pressure tactics employed once the feel good option of thinking about ones children and their education get exhausted.On a micro level, we learn more about, and almost sympathize with Steve, who truly believes in the good that his company is doing in offering a bail out for farmers whose livelihood comes under threat of inevitable change brought about by big money, and genuine concern about those who rescind such offers only to be seen blown away by the winds of change when it comes. If one is skeptical about Damons dramatic ability then this film may make you change your mind given his nuanced performance. Help of course comes in the form of veteran Frances Mc Dormand, who plays his colleague and partner in crime to fast track their offer, and stands for that check in progress whenever Steve uncharacteristically falters in his usual smooth talking ways. Rounding up the main leads come writer Krasinski himself, as a small time environmentalist out to tell people about the truth to reject big money, because it is unsafe, using personal anecdotes to push his point through. Its small time activist versus big time corporation with legal and marketing teams, so its anyones guess how this would pan out.And the outcome is nothing short of brilliance from the story, especially in its build up in presenting the case from both sides, with space for some romance thrown in for good measure as both camps slug it out for mindshare and heartshare using compelling arguments and guerrilla strategies, up until the final act where the true theme reveals itself – about lies and their impact. There are those in the world who can lie straight into your face without batting an eyelid, or write a report with malicious intent just because they can and are in a questionable state of mind thinking that their lies wont be seen through with a thorough enough research. It hits the mark squarely on the head as well on sales folks and their pitches, that once the deal is done youre never about to see them ever again, since theyve already moved on, and the fine print in contracts would be whats governing your life henceforth.There are those who base their arguments on compelling merits of their own, and there are those who base it on lies created to belittle others in an effort to paint a negative picture, hoping that the people you want to convince buys into your tirade against something. This film does all it can in having these points hammered by the narrative, until a scene that had struck me, involving the honesty of simple folk, who wants nothing but to carry on their simple, honest existence without the introduction of big money and its corrupting influence come put everything into a bind. Gus Van Sant has made a film with Matt Damon, with Damon giving up what would be his directorial effort, thats a cold hard look at the power corporations wield over the little guy, about the truth in controlling stakes and outcomes, and sets you thinking about this gulf of equality that never was to begin with. A thought provoking, highly recommended film!",True
"Simply, WOW !This movie is one of the best films i have ever watched by far. The direction of the film along with the acting was simply world class. Its an emotional rollercoaster. Yes it is slow, yes it gets a little boring, but whilst your watching the movie your always taking in the story line and my does the movie make up for it in the last 30 minutes when the jigsaw is put together and the full plot is revealed. I think this movie is actually better than The Pursuit Of Happiness which most will know was also a very good film. Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy and Barry Pepper all deserve awards with there 10 out of 10 performances. This movie for me is a must see, i am still actually getting over the film as it quite simply blew me away.10/10 easy",False
"A Three Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Di Caprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IM Dbs list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100  it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorseses best work.Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...) Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the nonstop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.Leonardo Di Caprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not Di Caprios best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in Superbad to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, Moneyball seemed to be an anomaly in Hils career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the films five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (Di Caprio). More likely it will walk away emptyhanded. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing.",True
"Powerful Film About Loneliness And Acceptance Remarkable. Touching. Riveting. Leaving Las Vegas is all of these and then some. I have not seen a film of this magnitude about loneliness and acceptance in such a while that I was in tears for much of the run time.Nicholas Cage is Ben, a man who has lost his wife and child, throws his job away, and takes all of his remaining money to buy as much liquor as possible and drink himself to death in the city of Las Vegas. He has given up all hope, with no wish to live, but for one reason or another, wants a companion to share in his misery, but not try to save him. He finds this companion in a hooker, Sera, played by Elizabeth Shue. They immediately form a strong relationship based on one night of talking about their lives. Sera in particular quickly grows attached to Ben, for no other reason than she has been alone her whole life and wants nothing more than to feel that want and need by someone.Cage won his first Oscar for his role as Ben, and how deserved it was. He was astounding, perfection, down to every single tick, the volume of his voice, the pain and tragedy buried in his eyes. I could not believe the extent of his role, the dedication and time he invested in bringing this character to life. Same goes for Elizabeth Shue, who with a simple glance at a person, she reveals her entire self, and no one even dares to notice except for Ben. This neediness is apparent, she wants to hold onto this relationship so badly, yet what makes their relationship work is total and complete acceptance of their respective decisions. He will not tell her to stop being a hooker, and she in return can never ask him to stop drinking. And it is in that factor that makes this film worth watching. To be totally accepted by those around them, to open themselves up to such an extreme.Leaving Las Vegas is a sobering film about connections, loneliness, acceptance, and a small little island of hope that is Ben and Sera. They are two good people, depicted in a world full of sorrows and misdeeds, who latch onto each other and never let go. They were nothing but ghosts, till that chance encounter, and became each others worlds. Cage and Shue bring these good people to life in such an extraordinary way, making Leaving Las Vegas a film to be treasured and remembered for years to come. I highly recommend this film.",False
"I liked it ...This is my first review on IM Db ever ... I am not even an amateur critic.The movie is almost completely dialogue. If you want an action flick or YA humour look elsewhere.Everyone did a great job of creating a unique character. And the characters interacted in a variety of interesting ways. And it was all realistic though exaggerated as all movies are.As always I loved Tina Fey, and found Jane Fonda interesting in her odd but very good acting technique and presentation.It was, in a word, poignant.I recommend it.",False
"More than a meow With The Day Today and its more acerbic followup Brasseye, supreme satirist Chris Morris made a mockery of the madness of the popular media by saying what he saw. It was funny because it could have been true. With Four Lions, Morriss focus is no longer on the manipulator, but rather the manipulated. Yet by presenting this jihad suicide squad as a group of bumbling misfits, chugging along the road to apotheosis in a car fitted with dodgy Jewish spark plugs, its still about the madness – here, the madness of a cracked ideology believed in mostly because its made up as it goes along.This is not really a film about Islam, or even religious fundamentalism, but identity. Omar (an excellent Riz Ahmed) speaks fluently about the Church of Mc Donalds and Western imperialism, and yet hes at the centre of a comfortable, suburban, upper working class family unit. Hassan (Arsher Ali) is an awkward, gangly virgin with a bone to pick with his Media Studies teacher. Barry (Nigel Lindsay, who some might remember playing a terrorist of a different creed in HB Os Rome) is white.For all their misadventures, theres a genuine tenderness and loyalty between these soldiers. This is a side of Morris weve rarely seen before – an emotional spine that raises the film far above what could have resembled a series of sketches or, worse, a reel of better outtakes. Perhaps this is the films greatest success: bringing its director out of the satirical shadows and into the comedy spotlight, and proving theres a heart to go with that clever head.",False
"One of the Sweetest Villains Ever When one pyramid of Egypt is stolen, the despicable suburban villain Gru feels frustrated since he considers himself the greatest criminal mind ever. However he plans to steal the moon, in the greatest heist of history, with the support of the evil Dr. Nefario and his army of minions. Gru intends to hire a loan in the Bank of Evil (former Lehman Brothers) to build a rocket and steal the shrink weapon to reduce the size of the moon. But the banker Mr. Perkins intends to invest in the young Vector, who actually had stolen the pyramid. When Gru robs the shrink weapon, Vector steals it from him and kept the weapon in his impenetrable fortress that is protected by state of art security system. Gru sees that the orphans Margo, Edith and Agnes from Miss Hatties Home for Girls have full access to Vectors house to sell cookies. Gru plots a scheme, adopting the three girls to use them to recover the shrink weapon from Vector. But the three little girls change the behavior of Gru and his minions.Despicable Me is a sort of contemporary version of the Charles Dickens classic novel A Christmas Carol and a highly entertaining animation with one of the sweetest villain ever, three adorable little girls and a group of adorable minions. The story is not corny but human, and the jokes with Bill Gates that is the source of inspiration of the nerd Vector and with the investment banking Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. that declared bankruptcy in 2008 and affected the lives of small private investors are witty. In the end, Gru is not the criminal mastermind that he supposed to be. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Meu Malvado Favorito (My Favorite Meanie)",False
"Spielberg in Olympic shape Its not just the fascinating true story behind this quintessential battle for freedom of the press  coupled to freedom for women  that makes this movie outstanding. Nor is it the knockout performances of Streep, Hanks and frankly most of the other actors. Not even the message that references the governments of this era and all their wrongdoings is what really struck me. Most of all it is Spielberg his directing in ultima forma that gave me the greatest thrill. Long yet exciting shots and sequences, a perfect atmosphere of the times and super simple scenes that he directed to become almost thrillerlike suspenseful... even when we already know the outcome! Yes, it has some flaws, such as the Spielbergsugar at the end. Sure. But ultimately, this is a masterpiece.",False
"Tears, Laughs, Life Lessons Greetings again from the darkness. The great Richard Pryor had a portion of his act dedicated to having a heart attack, based on his real life experience. I guess if he can generate laughter from a coronary, there is no reason writer Will Reiser and director Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) cant view Cancer as Comedy. There is little doubt that the subject matter of this film will limit its audience, but for those brave souls who give it a shot, I believe you will find it funny, touching and insightful.The film introduces us to Adam (Joseph Gordon Levitt) who is a very nice, very normal, very lowkey guy who works at a radio station as a writer ... a very conscientious radio writer. Adam experiences a nagging pain in his back, which is unusual for a healthy 27 year old. After a few tests, the emotionless doctor informs him that he has a rare spinal cancer ... also very unusual for a healthy 27 year old. From this point forward, the film borders on brilliance at times.Adams girlfriend is played by Bryce Dallas Howard; his mother by Angelica Huston; and his best friend by Seth Rogen. Each reacts in different ways to Adams diagnosis, but whats really interesting is not just how these people react, but also how Adam reacts. He moves forward in his meticulous manner, but all the while we know the emotions are brewing. We see this in his sessions with his therapistintraining played by Anna Kendrick.Seth Rogens character is basically a carbon copy of his act in 40 Year Old Virgin. He spews profane oneliners faster than our ears can process. Despite the aggressive front, Rogens character is a friend with a heart ... and one who doesnt hesitate to share his medicinal marijuana.So while Rogens character generates much of the laughter, the real treasure of this film is in the subtleties of each character in certain moments ... and each character has their moment. Many will compare this to Adam Sandlers film Funny People, which also starred Seth Rogen. But this movie has infinitely more depth and substance than that one offered.My warning: brace yourself. My theatre was filled with tears and sniffles, with significant laugh out loud moments mixed in. This is an emotional, selfreflective film that will confound you as you inexplicably laugh while listening to cancer talk.",False
"Visually beautiful, emotionally brutal.It takes a while for DOLLS to sink in.  Not because of the complexity of the stories intertwined through the film but because of the sheer emotional impact virtually every scene carries with it.I wont go into details about the three stories but I can say that, above all else, DOLLS is a lesson in love and anguish and it is by far Kitanos most powerful work, even more so than Hanabi.Im baffled by the negative reviews Ive seen of this film since it was first aired.  I wonder if it might be a case of the viewer needing to understand the way Japanese often tend to act and feel when faced with difficult or unbearable situations and without that understanding you might question if people would ever really act the way they do in DOLLS.  The answer is that often they really do.Ive considered Kitano a master film maker for a long time now.  The man has only ever made one film that cant be considered good (the embarrassingly poor Getting Any?) and I consider Hanabi in particular to be one of the finest films ever made.  But Dolls almost functions at another level.  I dont know how often I will watch it because it genuinely is emotionally draining but this is simply a brilliant piece of film making.  The cinematography is exquisite.  The acting is fantastic, especially Miho Kanno who gives such a tragic, beautiful performance while hardly saying a world throughout the film.  And above all, the emotional bond forged with the viewer is beyond any I think Ive ever seen on film.Anyone who truly loves film should see Dolls.  Actors should see Dolls if only to see how little you really need to give in order to portray real emotion.  Directors should see Dolls and learn from a master.  I genuinely believe Kitano will go down in history as a genius film maker.  Dolls may well be his masterpiece.",False
"jeff bridges at his best Jeff Bridges has been called the most underrated actor of his generation, and Fearless speaks to the truth of such a claim. Equally overlooked is Australian director Peter Weir, who, like Bridges, was snubbed by the Academy Awards for Fearless. The film was almost totally ignored by the Academy, perhaps due to the fact that 1994 was the year of the historical/political epic Schindlers List, In the Name of the Father, and The Remains of the Day were the big winners that year, casting a bit of a shadow over a film about a rich white American suffering from PTSD.Based on the novel by Rafael Yglesias, Fearless is the story of Max Klein, a successful San Francisco architect who survives a horrific plane crash. Among the casualties of the crash are Kleins partner and best friend and the only child of Carla (Rosie Perez), a young Puerto Rican woman from Oakland who blames herself for her sons death. Prior to the accident Max suffered from an acute fear of flying; when the plane goes down, his fear becomes so intense that he accepts death. When he survives the crash, he suffers from a form of posttraumatic stress syndrome in which he can no longer feel fear because subconsciously he has already faced death. His condition creates a rift between himself and his family, a gap he tries to fill through a friendship with Carla, who is similarly afflicted with PTSD.Bridges gives a tour de force performance as Max, who is simultaneously heroic (he leads other passengers to safety believing he is guiding them out of the plane into heaven) and contemptible (he is unspeakably cruel to his family and leaves his wife temporarily to pursue a relationship with Carla).Hes not sure whether hes alive or dead, and he is frequently drawn to test his fear and uncertainty through ludicrously dangerous stunts like dancing on the edge of a skyscrapers roof or walking calmly into speeding traffic. Its an unflinching and emotionally honest portrayal of a psychologically damaged man unsure that he has the strength or will to be healed. Equally stunning is Rosie Perez as Carla, a devout Catholic who believes that her babys death is a punishment from God and is nursed back to normalcy by the agnostic Max. Other supporting actors are also captivating: Isabella Rosselini as Maxs wife Laura, who loves her husband desperately but is unable to cope with Maxs alienation from her and their son Jonah; Tom Hulce as an overeager but wellmeaning attorney suing the airline on behalf of Max, his partners family, and Carla; John Turturro as a psychiatrist specializing in PTSD hired by the airline to help the survivors cope with the aftereffects of the tragedy; and Benicio Del Toro as Carlas husband, a poor carpenter who cant help but feel giddy about the possibility of making millions off of his sons death. Perhaps most moving is Deirdre O Connell as the widow of Maxs partnerthe scene in which Max arrives at her home to confirm that her husband did not survive the crash will break the hardest of hearts.The film is brilliantly directed by Weir, who captures the surreal nature of Maxs condition masterfully.Fearless is not an easy film to get through, perhaps even moreso in the wake of 9/11. The subject matter is emotionally wrenching, and its presentation is utterly unsentimental. Max is heroic, but he is also a victim, and Bridges performance captures the tension between Maxs newfound love of life and his nearpsychotic need to continually face and overcome his fears. Its a tearjerker, and its certainly haunted by the ghosts of the dead, but its wellworth watching if only for the pleasure of seeing one of the best actors in the business at his best.",False
"Despite dips into sentimentality, Labor Day is tender and heartbreaking.I loved the Labor Day script. I read it a few months ago and while I had doubts about the concept and Jason Reitman at first, it ended up winning me over within pages. Maybe its because it was written with such wit and tenderness, but its a human story that truly flows with the emotion delivering the images and intimacy required to express its ideas, dancing just above sentimentality. Although its story is slight, it was satisfying and very rich, taking a situation Im surprised it hasnt been explored in a more popular film and hitting major themes of family structures and cycles of life. It truly disappoints me to hear that people are not only disliking it, but hating it. It feels like its being approached from the worst perspective, bracing themselves to cringe. Im not exactly a Reitman fan either. I think Juno is terrible and it took a rewatch to fall in love with Up In The Air after thinking it was mediocre the first time.While Labor Day may be far from Reitmans regular tone, in execution it instead highlights his style of energetic and creative cinematography and editing. Like the effect of the script, you can feel the heat and taste the food. Surprisingly, as its a particularly challenging role given that these types of performances usually struggle, our kid protagonist Gattlin Griffith holds his own among the cast. Kate Winslet is reliably great. These characters seem to be her comfort zone and shes certainly perfected her craft, but we dont often enter her headspace. However, the real standout is Josh Brolin. His performance is the epitome of lessismore and sells his complex character perfectly. Sinister and cold, yet deep and sensual. The idea that hes doing all the mundane things he hasnt been able to do in decades brings simple delights. Its the measured moments where he cracks that show the breadth of his performance as he breaks down the stereotype of a convict.Unfortunately, some characters dont work very well, such as kid actors Barry and Eleanor who dont have the conviction to make their scenes work. The flashbacks to Franks past dont have the same effect as the script despite the eerily similar looking young actor, as theyre more confusing than clarifying. Contrary to common complaint, this is not like a lifetime movie. I happened to have watched some recently and theyre more concerned with twists and insanity, instead Labor Day is closer to a 1950s domestic melodrama. Think more Far From Heaven than anything. I have a little bias as to how much I like this film, but I walked into the script blind too. Though it need not have had the orchestra swell during the onthenose summary lines about what the films events mean to the characters, Labor Days emotional punch of two souls bonded by tragic pasts still breaks my heart. Im just glad Tobey Maguire helped rather than hurt.8/10",False
"Branagh is not Woody One of the most brilliant Woody Allens 90s pictures, such a mockery of the beautiful people with some traces of a romantic comedy and some reflexions about couple troubles made in Woody. But theres an objection and thats Kenneth Brannagh. Hes a great actor (no doubt about it) but in Celebrity you cant help thinking that hes imitating the character that Woody shouldve played. Its quite clear that Woody wrote this for himself, but he was too old to play a man that conquers Winona Ryder or Famke Janssen.Last but not least, what about Judy Davis?? God, shes magnificent, one of the best actresses ever, and that scene with the prostitute is totally hilarious. Woody shouldve married her instead of Mia 30 years ago!! So, if Woody wouldve played the role that eventually played Brannagh this couldve been one of his best works. But Brannagh is not Woody, and thats noticeable.*My rate: 7/10",False
"Surprising gem I saw this film on a plane  I know, I know, the worst place to see any kind of film  and thought I would just fall asleep as I didnt expect it to catch my interest enough to put up with the bad audio and small screens. In any case I dislike feelgood movies, and all the Kiwiinnovator stuff makes me cringe, Kiwis dont have the monopoly on being resourceful. And Id never heard of Burt Munro. So I was surprised to find within a few minutes I was entranced.Anthony Hopkins has made a brilliant job of the role, his accent wasnt too bad, and I loved the way he said Invercarrrrrrgill. Hopkins talent really shone  without him saying a word or changing his expression, you just knew how Burt felt when confronted by an apparently insurmountable obstacle (I wont spoil it) and his placid acceptance of the inevitable falls, tumbles and injuries told you that for Burt these were a fact of life. The other cast were also flawless, for me there wasnt a weak point in any of the acting. The humour was delivered in the main by Hopkins and with the lightest possible touch. The cinematography was beautiful and conveyed the journey from long quiet light of Munros idealism in Invercargill, murky orribleness of the necessary evil of passing through LA and laying your dream on the line in the harsh open glare of Utah.Hopkins has done a few of these slightlydisreputable, loveemwhenyougettoknowem characters but this is the best. And Im not a motorcycle fan, and no Kiwimadegood fan, but I will confess to a tear (almost) at the end when the text came up about Burts unbeaten record.If you watch this film at home you wont want to be disturbed by other people talking  youll want to catch every word, every nuance.",False
"I still whisper Take Shelter is a brooding, psychological thriller that does a wonderful job of generating foreboding and unease, while hinting at bigger thematic questions.Curtis is in construction, a steady guy in a steady job taking care of his family. His mate Dewart tells him, kindly and a little enviously, that he has a good life. That comment comes just as nightmares creep into the daytime for Curtis and the pressures of the possible descent of mental illness, and impending catastrophe, seep into his being. He makes the decision to tell no one but medical professionals. He needs help. But that does not mean his fears are unfounded.Michael Shannon is superb as madorishe? Curtis. When he gives voice to his darkest fears in a very public forum, he is the definition of unhinged. Jessica Chastain plays his putupon wife Samantha, and gets to test her range in a nightmare sequence where she is tempted by a breadknife and the sight of her husbands exposed neck. The look on her face had me pushing back in my seat.The film opens with big, brooding questions. Is Curtis somehow psychic? Is the approaching doom related to their daughters illness? Does the everpresent threat of economic ruin somehow inform these impending cataclysmic events? Horror film tropes are employed in the nightmare sequences, as Curtis wakes up just as he is attacked. This becomes slightly predictable at the third dream, and the film sags slightly in the second act. The twohours plus running time is a tad flabby. But Shannon is commanding, the cinematography eerily beautiful, and the ending deliciously straightforward and ambiguous.We live in uncertain times. Those who carry on blindly and trust it will be okay may be the maddest of us all. Take Shelter shows one man unravelling, and resonates with all our contemporary worries. Highly recommended.",True
"A Capote Edwards Cup Cake Even now 57 years after its original release, Breakfast At Tiffanys remains a charming love story between two hustlers of sorts. Audrey Hepburn is not the Holy Golightly that Truman Capote intended, she couldnt be but she was Audrey Hepburn in all of her 1961 glory. Amazing how it still works that Audrey Hepbun touch. George Peppard is gorgeous but impenetrable. Mickey Rooney, unforgivable. Henry Mancini, opportune but. strangely enough the character that fascinated me the most in my latest viewing is Patricia Neal. I would love to see a full movie about that woman. She exudes sensuality and smartness. Blake Edwards concocts a lighter fare from Capotes book and as it happens, its still very much alive and surprisingly relevant.",False
"Perfect chemistry I watched this film after a friend highly recommended it. The gay film festivals and critics awards and nominations its been getting are much deserved. Russell (Tom Cullen), a young gay man in Nottingham, UK, picks up Glen (Chris New) at a nightclub. They have a onenight stand but realize they share much more than animal attraction. They spend a weekend together trying to figure out whether or not they can turn this into something concrete. Weekend is part of the brief encounter subgenre I am a big fan of. Its a talkie for excellence; if you love films like Lost In Translation, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, youll probably be smitten by this as well. A naturalistic approach to filmmaking  especially to such a dialoguedriven narrative like this  is very hard to pull off; but writer/director/editor Andrew Haigh knows how to create sparks. Special kudos go to the excellent protagonists, Tom Cullen and Chris New, whose onscreen chemistry is palpable, moving, and simply a pleasure to watch. This is a weekend you shouldnt sleep through.",False
"Exhausting, Thrilling and Powerful.Paul Greengrass has proved his talents with two fantastic Bourne films, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, and two impressive reallife dramas, Bloody Sunday and United 93. Green Zone, while being a little like Bourne in Baghdad, was also a worthy thriller. Captain Phillips sees Greengrass deliver another true story to the big screen, proving that he is indeed the current king of cinematic reenactments.Tom Hanks gives one of his finest performances in a long time. His Captain Phillips is a professional, serious man that keeps his emotions in check while sternly ensuring his crew understands his expectations. As the situation escalates, his emotions begin to creep through. Leading towards a final release that is both heartbreaking and relieving. Hanks character isnt explored too deeply, but we are nevertheless with him every step of the way.In a fantastic casting choice, Tom Hanks is more than matched by Barkhad Abdi, who truly shines as the lead pirate. Were given more access than expected to this character – to all four pirates for that matter. Abdi manages to evoke empathy from a character that could have easily succumbed to stereotypical villainy. His performance provides a complex level of emotion to the proceedings. He knows that the situation has easily ran away from him, yet he naively decides to reassure himself – and Captain Phillips – every chance he gets.This is nononsense filmmaking of the highest order. Paul Greengrass kinetic camera rises above the sometimes dizzying approach from some of his last films. The handheld factor works beautifully here, ensuring the youarethere level of realism is cranked to a ten at every second. As the events escalate, we are always kept aware of what is happening. While skipper jargon and navy terms are exclaimed every which way, care is placed on making sure we still know exactly what is going on. Billy Ray (Breach, State of Play, The Hunger Games) constructs a taut and clear screenplay that compliments Greengrass filmmaking style.To call this tense is an understatement. Henry Jackmans score pushes every sequence to an almost unbearable level of tension, Barry Ackroyds cinematography beautifully captures the sweat and intensity of every moment, and Christopher Rouses masterful editing brings it all home.Exhausting and thrilling, Captain Phillips is all the more powerful with the knowledge that youre witnessing a true story.

"If all you saw in this movie was sex, I pity you.So many people wrote how disturbed they were by this shitty sex movie. I divide them into two groups: 1. First group decided to watch the film because they love sex, porn, and the title Nymphomaniac sure sounds like their kind of thing. Then they went to cinema (or Internet), watched it, and were disappointed because they had to listen to a lot of boring dialogues before there was a sex scene (to which they could masturbate to if they were alone). Then when a sex scene would finally come, it wasnt as exciting as it should have been. So they were disturbed at how much this movie didnt fulfill their expectations. And they are right, it didnt. Because its not a shitty, cheap movie, meant to get them turned on. As unbelievable as it sounds to them, the purpose of both the film and the sex scenes go much deeper. And if only they had bothered to pay a little more attention to the boring dialogue, perhaps they would have noticed that the meaning of the movie  and the real story  goes on in that conversation. And the sex scenes were not as sexy as they should have been, according to them, because its not about turning people on. Its a film for you brain, not your genitals. And that is precisely why people from the group one were disappointed. Good.2. The second group are the people who were disturbed because there were too many explicit sex scenes. I have nothing to say about this except: Are you serious??? Have you looked up the definition of the word nymphomaniac before you decided to watch it? And again, they missed the purpose because for some reason unknown to me, they were too focused on the filthy sex scenes in the film named ~Nymphomaniac~ that they missed to actually watch it. The point is: If you focus on the ~sex~, you wont like this movie, nor get it. Therefore, if you want a cheap turn on, just go watch porn, and let artists like Lars take sex to a different level, a little above the primitive urge. Because the reason Joe was a horny bitch is a little different than yours.",True
"A brutal murder. A brilliant killer. A cop who cant resist the danger.The 90s was a decade that was blessed with many great movies, yet there are none greater than that of Basic Instinct. It is a truly great film. With Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone heading a wonderful cast, this was one of the great thriller movies I can remember watching. It had everything a movie could want, a bit of mystery, sex, intrigue and murder. There will need to be a pretty good movie to replace this classic from the top as one of the greatest alltime thrillers. Nick Curran is a disgraced San Francisco police detective who helps investigate the murder of a prominent city official. Curran has a history of alcoholism and drug abuse although he is clean now. Catherine Tramell, the chief suspect, a spoiled rich girl with a background in psychology is toying with Currans mind. When Curran is taken off the case, he enters into a dangerous relationship with Tramell, which could have bad implications. Soon everyone Curran comes into contact with turns into a suspect.Undoubtedly, this movie is most famous for its high level sex scenes that it contains. While I did enjoy them, they are overrated just a fraction. I must admit Sharon Stone has an incredible body and she certainly knows all the moves. These scenes also turned Michael Douglas into a sex manic of sorts and partially ruined his first marriage to Diandra Luker. Yet they create quite a mood for this film and are the main reason why it was the success it was. The cast was great in this too. Michael Douglas is a Hollywood legend and this film only made him even more popular. His role as a the down and out cop was great. Douglas has some great films to his credit. These include Romancing the Stone, Fatal Attraction (not to similar to Basic Instinct), A Perfect Murder, and of recent Traffic (alongside his second wife Catherine Zeta Jones) and Dont say a word. Then what do you say about Sharon Stone? Before this film she was virtually an unknown, then she stormed on to our screens, without letting audiences take a breathe. Her film credits include The quick and the dead, Total Recall and The Specialist.
Other cast members include Jeanne Tripplehorn, who played Currans exwife and Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Garner. Her role made me feel very anxious to realise what was going to happen. The sex scene involving her was a little hard to take. Then you have the good guy of the film, Gus, played by George Dzundza, but the way we see him go is also too much to handle. One other actress I did recognise, was Leilani Saralle, who played one of Catherine Tramells gay lovers, Roxy. Basic Instinct had a very good director, that being Paul Verhoven. He made this film extremely well and any other director might have got it wrong. He has made some other good films including Robo Cop, Starship Troopers and Total Recall. He did do one big flop, that being Showgirls. He commented on that film by saying `I think it was bad too. I am sorry Paul, but you were right. Basic Intincts script was pretty good in how it left you dangling. It was like you were in a big game of cat and mouse. I can understand that some people might not like it for that reason, but I thought it was good. The movie also had a great musical score attached to it, giving the movie a chilling feel to it. So, all in all Basic Instinct is a film that I will always remember. It was so controversial that where I come from, I remember people needed to show there ID to get into the local cinemas, because of its sexual and violent content. I dont blame the cinemas for doing so, because it is not suitable for young eyes to see. If you want to watch a great thriller, then sit down and watch Basic Instinct. Trust me its nice!Rating: 5 stars or 10/10",False
"This Film has Oscars written all over it I had not read anything about this film and I went to see Lion yesterday. I was moved, I was shocked. I had tears in my eyes and the hair on my skin stood up. I could listen to my own heart beats while watching this film. It has never happened to me before when I saw a film and I was touched immensely. The film took me back to my roots and streets where I grew up. I am from Pakistan and I have been living in San Francisco for the last 15 years. I come from that part of the world where this story takes place. I grew up in streets like the streets of the movie Lion. I have met many children who collect garbage to make a living and are lost in the streets of this universe. They sleep alone on card board boxes at night and when you look at them , there is a question in their eyes. The world has forgotten about these children and there are thousands of these children on the streets of India and Pakistan. Do you really know what it feels like when you are only 5 years old and lost in some crowded street in a big city and do not know how to get home? To the boy who played Saroo (Sunny Pawar), I want to give you an Academy Award. The film grabs you from the beginning as it starts out with showing a beautiful relationship between two brothers who are running on a train track. The actress who played mother (Priyanka Bose)touched my heart. Her performance is breathtaking. The way she looks at her sons, shows you how a mother pours her heart with love when she looks at her children. There are no words to express that feeling and actress gave her full self and emotions to play this role from young to old. It is commendable and her acting moved me and reminded me of my own mother. There are so many things which I think my mother does not know about me but the way she looks at me, I know she knows. Lost Saroo looks around for Guddu at the dark train station and then looks for Guddu everywhere, in his thoughts for the rest of his life. What a beautiful role of Guddu played by Abhishek Bharate and what a promising actor! There were some real gripping performances in this film by actors which had only small roles in the film but they left their mark and touched me. I want to give a big hug to Garth Davis for choosing these powerful actors and giving them a chance to express their emotions. I must mention Tannishtha Chattergee, who knew her character and made a mark with just two scenes. Now thats called Actor.I have always seen Nicole Kidman in great grandeur roles. But I was shocked to see her in Lion. A small role with few scenes. She gave herself all. Her performance in Lion is heartfelt. The cinematographer was able to capture her emotions and her heart on the big screen. David Wenham, plays the part of father to Saroo with amazing acting skills and warmth. Dev Patel, you did a good job.I want to give a big salute to all the filmmakers and actors who were involved in making this film. You have done an exceptional job and gave me something which will be in my mind and heart for a very long time. If any actors or filmmakers want to reach out to me please email at hassanzeeatgmail",False
"Great chemistry I thought the intellectual chess game between Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling was pure joy. What a pleasure to watch the two play mind games with each other  with the audience in on the action. Thought the pace was good, the direction suspenseful. The only aspect of the movie that I would say was less than A+ was the love interest between Ryan Gosling and Rosamund Pike. I thought it a bit confusing that she was both his boss and his love interest. Not sure they needed the full love interest in the plot. All in all, a most entertaining movie. Other than that, the plot line of the legal case was engaging, understandable and realistic. I highly recommend it to those interested in movies that make you think.",False
"Wonderful, joyous piece of America where dreams are possible!I truly believe that every once in a blue moon, a film can contain a sense of wonder, magic, and the power of dreams. The title says it all. Field of Dreams is destined to become (if it hasnt already) an American classic, and easily one of the most engrossing films of the eighties. Throughout the decade, we have seen a crock of films that capitalized on getting as much of anything the characters could grasp (hence the me decade). This film, made in 1989, reaffirmed what we learned from Hollywood in the forties, that dreams can come true and people can be saved by what they choose to believe in. And to top it all off, baseball is its subject. The great American pastime takes on a mystical quality that is nothing but immortal.     Kevin Costner plays Ray Kinsella, a corn farmer that seems to be stranded in his life, only choosing his profession because it allowed him to get away from the idealized dreams of his father that never became reality. One day, while roaming aimlessly through his cornfield, he hears a unknown voice speak to him, saying the words that have become synonomous with the film itself, If you build it, he will come. He is compelled by the strange message, and even convinces his wife what he heard was real and definite. He believes that the simple words mean he is to build a baseball diamond in his field, and he sets out to do just that, and he indeed does one heck of a job. After at least half a year passes, following endless strains on their patience, who should show up in the field but Shoeless Joe Jackson, the famous alleged criminal from the 1919 Black Sox Scandal who was dismissed from the game of baseball forever, until now...     After all that is said and done, the film takes a back road and curves it into this storyline brilliantly. Ray receives a second message which he deciphers as getting a famous civil rights writer, Terence Mann (played wonderfully by James Earl Jones), to come visit his new ballfield. Of course it is to be expected that Mann begrudgingly resists Ray to join him, but he too becomes propelled by the power of the fields magic, and his life (like Rays) is changed forever. Even Burt Lancaster shows up out of thin air (literally), but thats a different part of the plot altogether that I wouldnt dare reveal in fear someone reading this review has incompetently not seen this picture.   Field of Dreams is one of the strangest films Ive seen, and possibly one of the best. When it throws its subject matter at you, you wonder how a story so preposterous can ever work. But somehow, I was deeply moved like Costner and Jones were by the miraculous incidents put in front of me. This film is not like any fantasy film Ive seen, but in a way, it is like many that Ive encountered. Some of my favorite movies elicited such an amazing feeling of warmth and grace in me that I was afraid to analyse it for fear that it would ruin the awesome impact I received. Field of Dreams is exactly like that, an odd piece of moviemaking that overwhelms you with its wonder and positive qualities that in turn leaves no doubt it is a classic, just from the way it moves you while watching it. Therefore, Im not going to try to pick it apart and attempt to show the world my field of brilliance. All I will say is this is the kind of movie Hollywood should be reeling out more often, a tiny masterpiece that lets others be refreshed in their faith and believe in their crazy little fantasies. Ray Kinsella did, and now, so do I. Rating: Four stars.",False
"Nice film The Kings of Summer was a nice comingofage film about 3 teenage boys who want independence so decide to build a house in the woods away from the real world.I really like the plot and the actors all done a very good job. The 3 boys were believable and extremely likable. The supporting cast were also very good. The house they build looks brilliant. The story is a lot about friendship which is really nice. There was some moments that made you smile but it wasnt overly funny, I would class it as more of a drama film.Overall it was an enjoyable film, a really meaningful story which is easy to relate to. Definitely worth a watch if you want something to cheer you up.7.5/10.",False

Im not going to subscribe to Spike Lees objections because that would imply taking this seriously. Mr. Tarantinos ignorance is just monumental, monumental! but, Im afraid, very much the sign of the times. Lets make it about nothing with super violence to keep the crowds cheering. What about taking a little responsibility sir? Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz and the rest of the cast do a credible job, inhabiting Tarantinos makeshift universe. Sergio Corbucci is your hero, but not John Ford, okay, that makes sense in your world, Mr Tarantino but please, stop preaching. Make movies but dont pretend that there is depth in your shallowness.

"Naked Owns Cinema.My favourite film of all time and I dont even know why. It not only is repulsive but at the same time hysterically funny. It makes living in London a distorted pleasure as it is on my mind every day as I walk through the city that inspired such a piece. The theories that Johnny comes up with are not only salient but increasingly prophetic and it serves as a reminder to Mike Leighs brilliance that a film ORIGINALLY intended as a Post Thatcherite comment can now be seen as a highly accurate portrait of 21st century Britain. The dialogue is razor sharp and the thoughts and ideas explored may be too In Your Face for some but it is a film that every adult should see. It makes you face what you are and that may make it an uncomfortable experience but the result is, for good or ill, life changing. For that, it is, to me the greatest film of all time.aonemantidalwave",True
"Im famous for my intolerance.Vicky (a neurotic and sexy Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (a neurotic and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson) are two American tourists in Spain examining their differing views on love in Woody Allens breezy and alluring Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Amidst a tempestuous summer in Barcelona, the ladies are both seduced by a freethinking painter (a perfect Javier Bardem) whose own life is complicated by his still passionate relationship with his exwife (a devastating Penelope Cruz, who has never looked more beautiful).Much like the change from New York City to London invigorated Allen in Match Point, this vacation to Spain has revived some of the directors more artistic aspirations. The scenery is postcard perfect but drenched in that same dizzying lushness that made Allens view of NYC so intoxicating in Manhattan. The churches, the homes, the art museums, the countryside, the intimate city streets and touristy details make you feel like you are visiting Barcelona along with Allen and his cast.Theres also sharpness to the trademark Woody dialog that has been missing for quite some time. Like all of Allen films, this one is endlessly talky, but theres some great subversion when certain lines that seem like throwaways actually pack a punch when given a second thought. When Bardem first attempts to talk Johanssons character into bed, he says something clichéd about her being hard to please. Quick witted, Johansson replies, Im famous for my intolerance. She says it casually, but it packs a bite as its the complete antithesis of her characters outward desire to be someone who rallies against cultural norms, and she presents herself as someone who is easygoing and tolerant of all.Allen also displays a keen sense of pacing when he creates tension in his build up to Cruzs appearance after her character is endlessly talked about but never seen until about half way through the film. When Cruz finally arrives, her moody whirling dervish of a performance is the perfect spice to liven up the soupy proceedings. Her seething, fiery line readings combined with looks that could kill make her the frontrunner for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars.The baseline archetypal characters are essentially clichéd, but the way in which Allen handles all of their interpersonal relationships is fairly sophisticated and entertaining even when it grows absurd. There is of course that kiss between Scarlett and Penelope but also some moments of Lynchianlite when Allen photographs the brunette Hall and blonde Johansson similarly to make them seem like they are two sides of the same woman. Theres even more weirdness when diehard Woody fans realize that in some perverse way Scarlett Johanssons character is the Woody partas in any film he does not star, there is always one character who represents the part he wouldve played had he been in it. However, film buffs will enjoy some of the nice touches like when Hall and another go to see Hitchcocks Shadow of a Doubt (one of my all time favorite films) or the repetitive use of a Spanish guitar in the soundtrack whenever Bardem and Hall get together. But then theres the mostly unnecessary voiceover narration that fills in expository gaps and shows Allen can still be a lazy tactician.Woody Allen has always been an acquired taste, even more so in his latter years when he sometimes forgets how to provoke, but his fans should be delighted with this latest European flavored effort. In the end, youll feel like Javier Bardem is the luckiest man in the world, Penelope Cruz is operating at the echelon of her appeal, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, well, theyll always have Barcelona.",True
"This part is all about stalling and making money in the process Ive anticipated that being the last Harry potter they would divide this part into 2 separate ones (just like with the matrix) while in fact there is no other reason to do so other then make people spend their money twice.Ive enjoyed all of the harry potters up until this one. Many scenes are just plain boring with little magic and little conversation, its actually quite depressing with not much going on.When the movie finally ended I just gazed at the screen thinking: did anything funny just happen?. No. I feel the actors also played on autopilot. Its as if you can tell when someone will react in a way on certain events. I also think there were some parallels with Lord of the rings. Maybe the author ran out of ideas..I wouldnt recommend seeing this movie to anyone. Unfortunately I obligated myself to see part 2. Hope it will make up for this crap.",False

"An Intensely Captivating Experience.The Walk is a visual masterpiece with a captivating story and superb acting. It was intense, thrilling, and emotional. The cinematography was top notch and the CGI was impeccable. This was truly an amazing cinematic experience that was made for IMAX 3D. The basic story of The Walk is this: a French street performer becomes obsessed with hanging a high wire between the two Twin Towers and walking on it. He flies to New York, recruits a few people to help him, and after weeks of of planning, is ready to perform an impossible stunt that will be remembered forever. The script is very well written and the story comes across very nicely to the viewer. It focuses on all the right moments for the right amount of time, which means the pacing is generally good. My only problem arises in the beginning as I felt it was a little rushed. Character development is also not the finest, but it is enough to make the viewer care about the characters. Other than that the story was told in a very captivating way that left viewer on the edge of their seat.The Walk is a visual treat, specifically the last part of the film. There are magnificent, swooping camera shots showing off the beautiful Twin Towers in all their glory and with IMAX 3D, the viewer feels like they are thousands of feet in the air on the high wire. There were multiple times in this movie where vertigo kicked in due to the crazy heights portrayed in the film. The cinematography really helps the viewer become immersed in the experience as there are so many memorable shots of the Twin Towers and views of New York City. The CGI used to create this wonderful experience looks insanely real and really makes one appreciate the beauty and height of the Twin Towers. When Philippe Petit is on the high wire, wind and distant traffic noises are added to the incredible CGI to enhance the feeling of being 110 stories up in the air and with moving camera angles, the experience is beautiful and realistic. The acting in this movie is superb. Joseph Gordon Levitt is amazing as Philippe Petit and really does a good job showing how insane Petit really was. Charlotte Le Bon also does a fine job portraying Petits girlfriend, and Ben Kingsley gives a good performance as Petits mentor. All the supporting cast give great performances as well.Robert Zemeckis does an amazing job making this movie as intense and thrilling as possible. His direction really made this movie what it is; and it is visual spectacle told within a great story. In the end, The Walk is a visually thrilling and intensely told masterpiece. It boast beautiful cinematography, flawless CGI, great acting and direction, and a captivating story. This is truly a movie to behold in IMAX 3D and one will come out of the theater feeling immensely satisfied with the experience. The Twin Towers were beautifully portrayed in this movie and made one appreciate their existence even more. I am proud to say that this is one of the best and most satisfying movie experiences of this year.",False
"Bigger splash  biggest yawn Rockstar Marianne (Tilda Swinton) is recuperating on an Italian island after throat surgery, with her filmmaker lover (Mattias Schoenaerts) for company. Then an ex of hers turns up, loud and boozy recordproducer Harry (Ralph Fiennes), with his nymphette daughter (Dakota Johnson). Marianne can only speak in whispers, but Harry could  and does  talk for England. The reunion rapidly turns from jolly reminiscence to sullen silences and naked confrontation. Emphasize the naked. There are a lot of nude swimming scenes. Ralph Fiennes who, with or without his kit on, plays the whole movie in manic overdrive. Matthias and Dakota have lowerkey roles and are easier to watch. Despite concert and studio flashbacks I never for a moment believed in Swinton as a rock goddess  shes meant to be a sort of female Bowie. Swinton, like a latterday Katherine Hepburn, brings energy and a kind of dry mockery to most of her roles: admirable but not always likable.This is a remake of a 1969 French movie, LA PISCINE, which starred Alain Delon in the Schoenaerts role. There are strong echoes too of the identically titled 2003 Charlotte Rampling picture SWIMMING POOL, which had a similar slowburning intensity. A BIGGER SPLASH has a cast of attractive people playing unattractive mindgames in a picturesque setting. Clever but boring.",True
"Hands down, the best summer movie of 2011Of all the movies that can possibly be rebooted......why reboot another movie thats already been rebooted? And of all the projects that the Weta team can possibly tackle, why this one? Well it must be the script, because everyone thats come across it has wanted to be somewhat involved. Hopefully it lives up to the expectations that are already in place, because i dont think i could handle another stink bomb like Burtons version.Finally......a summer movie thats actually WORTH your summer dollar. Almost every element of this film is pitch perfect. Just what makes this oh so great? Allow me to explain....Judging from the preview, i thought the movie to be a little too relative to the concept from Deep Blue Sea. But this movie takes a much more different route with their Alzheimers approach. Needless to say, they did a much better job than that movie.....obviously.I know most people may be scratching their heads to this comment, but in my opinion, this is easily the most well written script of the year thus far. Its intelligent, thought provoking, emotional, and damn well entertaining. What makes this so good is the progression of the main ape Ceaser (heh, ironic name), and his journey from a curious and smart ape, into an upset ape that realizes the harsh realities of being treated like an animal. Its now easy to see just why everyone jumped on board when they read this. I kid you not, i actually got goosebumps from this movie, and that rarely happens.And once again, the Weta team did a phenomenal job with their brilliant special effects. Andy Serkis who has already done work like this before in Lord of Rings and King Kong, out preformed most actors in Hollywood without barely saying a word. Is it wrong to say that a man in a blue suit with dots all over him, imitating an ape is so far the best actor ive seen this year? Uh.....not at all. Trust me, see the movie, and youll understand why.Bottom Line.......not only is this easily the best movie of the summer, i will go as far as saying its the best movie i have seen so far this year. Yes, it is THAT good. Like i said earlier, almost every element of this movie is pitch perfect. The writing, the acting, the special effects.....all done to near perfection. It some peoples eyes, this is called a reboot. However, it feels more like a prequel. But judging from what i just saw, i hope to god that they make more of these, because it literally just blew my mind.",False
"7.4????? Are you people insane???This is clearly one of the great animated features of all time. How it squeaks by with a mere 7.4 voter average while all sorts of contemporary crap does far better is a mystery and a tribute to the downward spiral in cinematic taste. DUMBO is my favorite of all the classic Disney films (a group which ends with JUNGLE BOOK, completed after Walts death). Nothing since then has been able to recapture the magic. Walt may have been, according to some people, a fascist and an anti Semite, but he was also a genius.Things that make this movie great: The animation (I used to work at a zoo, and while the real elephants did little talking or singing the animators captured their body language incredibly well.)Pink Elephants on Parade.Effective but not overthetop heartstring tugging.The musical crow number (When I See an Elephant Fly). Im disappointed to discover the voice actors (Including Cliff Edwards, Ukelele Ike and the voice of Jiminy Cricket) were white guys playing black  I was hoping they were some cool unknown black combo  but its a terrific number anyway.The 64 minute running time.

"This way its poetry...This is the simple and captivating story of Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins, fantastic like the whole cast), a young guy who decides to form a soul band in Dublin, and all the amazing people who join him. Theyve got musical talent and big dreams, but is that enough to climb to the top (and stay there)? Alan Parker has made some very diverse films (Midnight Express, Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Angelas Ashes) in his long career, but you can see that music is in his blood and one of his favourite themes (Bugsy Malone, Fame, Pink Floyd The Wall, Evita). He orchestrates a mostly unknown cast (which includes a very young Glen Hansard, from the recent hit Once) in a tale of hope, determination, and great music. The British have a great eye for the bittersweet side of life and misfits in general (The Full Monty, Little Voice, Billy Elliot are fine examples), often with music as an important factor in the background (coincidence? I dont think so!). The Commitments is a beautiful, cheerful film, as passionate and memorable as Cameron Crowes masterpiece Almost Famous, and certainly one of the best music films of all time. 10/10.",False
"One of the best debut features of the year Directed by the young talent Cary Fukunaga, a winner of the Sundance Film Festival Directing award, the film focuses on a combination of issues in South America, from involvement of kids and teenagers in Mexican gangs to what it takes for those who decide to leave South and Central America and seek greener pastures in the U.S.The story follows two main characters, Casper and Sayra, played by lesserknown actors Edgar Flores and Paulina Gaitan. While Casper is the member of the feared gang Mara Salvatrucha, his faith connects him with Sayra, a Honduran emigrant that travels with her father and uncle together with the other emigrants on a freight train to the U.S.On this journey together, as Casper tries to escape his faith and Sayra to meet hers, the main characters are slowly blending together, complete each other through their diversity, while they have to face the rough side of life in todays Mexico.As a result, the film has a gripping, disturbing, moving soursweet blend to it, and is exactly the type of the film where its unpredictability, natural change of pace, and lots of eye candy in the scenery, makes you part of the story until the credits role, making you beg for more inside.Fukunagas film feels so real not only thanks to his time spent in Mexico and his first hand experience with both, emigrants and immigrants he met before and while shooting the film, his cast of actual members of the Mara gang, perfect editing and combination of locations and the effort he took while filming to get the best out of his actors (apart from beating them, he joked at Vary), makes the film one of the best feature debuts Ive ever seen.",False

"Poetry to Visual Affect This is not Shakespeares best play, but it has his best poetry; thats because the play is ABOUT language, about the difference between what something is and the language used to describe it. So among the plays, this may be one of the hardest to film. But alas it suffers from another blessing which is also a curse: the story itself is so powerful that one can build any sort of film or play or whatever around it and have it be likely to work. Thus, we often lose the language.Zefrelli made his own choices in the earlier film; these were relatively conventional. While it cut some valuable language, sacrificed to the gods of contemporary patience, it is by far the better version. But here we have some interesting choices.First the setting. Italians to Shakespeares England were a comical people, and his setting of the play there would have encouraged the audience to bring heavy stereotypes to the drama. Latins in his day were considered: Foppish: Quick to violence (a stereotype that has been inherited by blacks today, but to Londoners, Italians were nearly Africans): Incredibly proud especially as regards slights to masculinity: Obsessed with weapons.Today, we roll those up under the relatively crude notion of stupid Latin macho. In this film, the director has exaggerated the Latin macho ethic to have the same effect 16th century Londoners would get. It works because these stereotypes are powerful memes which attract many hosts which perpetuate their underlying truth. Baz adds the additional dimension of the people being captured by the superstitious underbelly of the Church.He deliberately straddles the border between apparent truth and satire. These Latins are superficial visually and not verbally. So here is the solution to the problem on how to make a film (which is primarily a visual medium) out of a play that leverages poetic language. The solution is to convert all the metaphors from language to vision. Hence the muchnoted lack of poetry. I imagine Baz directing the players to not worry so much about the poetry.Both Romeo and Juliet are incapable of performing the poetry anyway: they are children learning on the job. And what acting skill they have from film is all in the face, not the tongue. They are pretty enough though.I like this film for its boldness. Some of the experiment works since we get the message of the difference between what we see and what is true. This is why Juliet has to see a LIVE Romeo at the end. Living under water is used to good effect. But in the real play, there are so many and such subtle explorations of the theme, and these are scoured away here for a few broad effects. The real message, which comes through loud and clear if you know the play (or even Zefrellis film) is not the distance between the reality of events and the language, but the reality of the richness of the real play and this film. Equally vast. Equally powerful statement. So we have a playhouse with the back part blasted out to the sea.As a separate matter, the play has three anchors: Mercutio, the Friar and the Nurse. These are handled interestingly here.The Friar is an alchemical master hiding under the cloak of the Church. The play equates the magic of language with the magic of potions, equally deadly. The congruence is lost in this film, but Baz definitely gets the magic part as well as the superfluous ritual of the church. This friar is a terrific, memorable performance of someone who believes he can defeat nature. Serves as an anchor as intended.The Nurse is the true domestic, raw nature, full of uncompromised loyalty but ultimately compromised. Her character is lost here. We NEED to know about the dead sister and why the nurse turns on Juliet in order to save her life. Baz fails here, and so provides no center. For Shakespeare, shes the white space on the palette.Mercutio in the play is a emotionally engaged visionary mystic. We understand that Romeo and Mercutio studied magic (`philosophy) abroad together much as Hamlet and Horatio had. The dream they shared the night before is the axis of the whole action: rather like the magic of the witches in Macbeth. Baz gets this as well: Modern magic is what? Drugs. So Hamlet is given a psychotropic by Mercutio before going to the party. Works for me, because it allows everything to be visually blasted and inexorably tragic. The whole thing after the party is a trip, see? It is why they can meet, become entranced and arrange marriage after an hour or two. (Remember that until this point Romeo is hopelessly smitten by Roseline.)Anyone who wrestles with problems of filming the Bard and comes out alive deserves my respect. This is a weird interpretation, but thats the point.",True
"Hall Leaves On A High Note Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on. He did himself proud as this is one of the bestlooking crime films youll ever see.Of course, the acting aint bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the leads! The amount of action in here is just right, too: not too much; not too little.None of the characters in here, frankly, are good guys as Hanks is a professional hitman for town boss Newman. Hanks only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him, although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies! Huh?As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is cinematographer Hall, who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens. His work is just awesome.",False
"Colin Firth and Julianne Moore shine (as usual) in Tom Fords brilliant directorial debut Tom Ford, you surprised me. I dont really follow the fashion world too closely at all, so although I naturally knew his name, I wasnt familiar with his creations. I havent read the Christopher Isherwood novel (yet), so Colin Firth and Julianne Moore were the ones who actually got me excited for this project. And I wasnt disappointed – it actually exceeded all my expectations, and alongside Jane Campions Bright Star (which unfortunately is being almost completely overlooked this awards season), its the most poetic 2009 film I have seen so far.Firth, always elegant and fascinating, plays George Falconer, a British professor in 1960s Los Angeles trying to cope with the death of his longterm partner, Jim (Matthew Goode). Its been eight months since Jims death, and George decided to end his life by the end of the day – and its this day we see in this admirable film. George spends time with his best friend Charley (the always wonderful Julianne Moore), with whom he had something in the past (and still has hopes of winning him over again), and now is an unhappy divorcée. A young pupil, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult, who has grown up a lot since About a Boy and The Weather Man), who clearly is infatuated with George, harasses him until he finally gives him the attention he craves. These two different encounters will be decisive for George. As sad as the overall tone and the theme of mourning can be, A Single Man is by no means depressing. Ford uses and abuses of artsy, but very efficient and intriguing camera angles, and a classy score by Polish composer Abel Korzeniowski. Eyes, lips are shown in evidence throughout the film, and naturally, the costumes are all superb. Georges long days journey reminds me a lot of Virginia Woolfs classic Mrs. Dalloway. Marleen Gorris was able to do a correct but somewhat cold adaptation of Woolfs novel in 1997 (scripted by Woolf scholar and talented actress Eileen Atkins, featuring the magnificent Vanessa Redgrave in the title role), but I thought she wasnt much to blame for the films coldness since thats one of the most complex novels to be translated to the screen. After seeing A Single Man, I even dare to say Tom Ford could do an interesting and very personal adaptation of Mrs. Dalloway. Also, this is one of the sexiest films since Alfonso Cuarons Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001) and Bernardo Bertoluccis The Dreamers (2003), and Nicholas Hoults incandescent presence has a lot to do with that. He gives an efficient, brave performance for an actor his age, and although Im sure Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot), who was the first choice for the role, wouldve been terrific, Hoult doesnt disappoint. Its not every day were given a film with such emotional intensity and exuberant sensuality, and A Single Man proves that Tom Ford is certainly a promising director, having given us not just a great first film, but one also one of the years finest and most unusual creations. A film to be felt and celebrated, and I cant wait for the DVD  its a keeper. 10/10.",True
"Must See Flick The name of the film always put me off watching it. Ever so glad i was convinced in to it. Only the fact that there is so much bad language and for Titanic being released in the same year this would have swept the boards in the Oscars!I hate Robin Williams as a comedian, but i was in tears after watching his timeless performance. I love most of the classic movies but this is definitely the best film i have ever seen Mat Damon played a great part, showing the full spectrum of emotions in his role.Ive ever gone out and bought the soundtrack to the film, ive watched it half a dozen times and always go right through to the final credits.Pure brilliance!",True
"Little Women in its own right Though some may argue that the older classic versions of Little Women with Katherine Hepburn and June Allison may be better because it sticks to the book, this is the only version that captures the spirit of the book.Though the filmmakers took license to cut away certain specifics, the end result is an absolutely gorgeous film that stands on its own completely. One would be able to watch this film without ever having read or known the book and seen it as its own film.The film thrives on small scenes and nuances, moments of person to person contact, production design and cinematography, the all important score (which adds a great deal to the film). This delicate and complicated symbiosis between all aspects tactfully and poignantly creates the story, something missing from many movies these days which creates a tangible and effervescent emotional layer. Then the acting of one of the best ensembles to hit the screen in a long time. Keep an eye out for Susan Sarandon and Claire Daines in roles that ought to have been nominated along with Ryder. These actors create people that endear themselves to us, and make the film even more than it could have been.Its a small scale masterpiece that will leave you in tears. The film is honest and true in its portrayal of human emotion. It went from being an adaptation of the book to its own story and portrayal of people and their lives. Its beautiful aesthetically and dramatically, and a real gem of a film.",False
"Dead Ringers is not dead on David Cronenberg has never made a bad movie, and I dont think he ever will, but Dead Ringers, despite some great ideas, did not impress me. Dead Ringers is convoluted and seemingly pointless. The premise starts off simple, but the screenplay makes it more complex than necessary.Dead Ringers focuses on twin brothers Bev and Elliot who are rich and renowned gynaecologists. Their success and popularity comes from working closely together, but things go south when they meet the young actress Claire Niveau which whom they each have an affair. The emotional aftermath, messes up not only their work, but their mindset and mental stability. The movie starts off quite well actually, Its interesting to see Jeremy Irons play two different characters in the same scenes. Good acting and pacing keeps Dead Ringers stable for the first hour but around the half way point, it starts to deteriorate, eventually collapsing under the weight of its complexity. The dialog gets weak, character development becomes unclear, And the ending is abrupt and silly.I suppose the fact that the movie is adapted from a novel explains some of the complexity. As Ive noticed, good filmmakers usually try to be loyal to the novels or literary works they adapt from, when they do so. Adapted or not, I think Dead Ringers is occasionally thought provoking and clever but not an especially competent film.",False
"Best Film of 2004Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Well, if youre familiar with Kaufmans work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself What the hell is going on?, but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but Im glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joels head.If you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.But if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, thats beautiful, crazy, give me whatever hes smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufmans writing is always clever, but this time hes oneupped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but Eternal Sunshine manages to dazzle you with its originality and its poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a selfconsciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.Michel Gondrys use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers. Eternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of Best of 2004.",True
"The quintessential boy/dog movie The quintessential boy/dog movie. It does have obvious correlations with Marjorie Rawlings The Yearling. I first saw this film on TV when I was six years old or so. Interestingly, at that time, I remember the Chuck Connors character as menacing and almost evil. On viewing as an adult, that character was a perfect gentleman, giving up the dog to the boy when he was under absolutely no obligation to do so. Also interesting to see the casual, and basically unnoticed cruelty of the Travis character toward the little girl. I dont remember even noticing that as a child. Disney knew how to make real family entertainment in those days. Now, it seems that material suitable for children is targeted directly at them, and is generally a chore for adults to sit through. OY found a way to split the difference. Truly a classic.",False
"A moral tale, a powerful film inaudibly told A loner and outsider gets alarmed when informed of someones release from prison and sets out to find him. Following this, a series of killings take place but since the main character is not a professional hit man he seems to be getting into deeper and deeper trouble.This is for the most part a moral tale. One is convicted for a committed crime and the family of the victim feels it appropriate to murder him upon his release based on a fear for reprisals. When you think you have a justifiable cause to kill another human being, a Pandoras box opens and you better be prepared for the consequences.Edgy and intense it has confirmed my affection for independent cinema and despite some flaws in its storyline it has an air of originality attached to it.",True
"A study in ethics Although `Quiz Show is entirely concerned with morality and the nature of moral choices, I cant think of a single moment when it isnt obvious whether or not a character is doing the right thing.  There are no moral dilemmas whatever.  And a good thing too  thorny ethical issues would only turn it into an episode of `Star Trek.  If you think a film needs to be confused about right and wrong in order to be interesting, watch `Quiz Show and realise your error.Heres most of the ethics in a nutshell: the star contestants of a popular quiz show are cheating, with the connivance of the producers, the sponsor, and the network.  That they shouldnt be cheating is never in dispute.  The interesting questions are:  Why are they cheating?  and, What is it like for them, and how do they maintain dignity, when theyre found out?  Of course, in an intelligent character study like this there are plenty of other questions.  I wont ruin your pleasure by giving away any of the answers. The best scenes, probably, are the ones in which a character must admit to someone or some group of people that he has cheated.  All these scenes are very good and each is handled in a different way.  But theyre just cherries in a rich fruitcake.  `Quiz Show is one of my personal favourites.  It was nominated for Best Picture of 1994  an unusually fertile year  although the award went instead to some big dumb propaganda piece.",True
"Tedious, pretentious and utterly exhausting Upstream Color begins as a puzzling but reasonably coherent movie; much of the beginning is a disturbing and unpleasant but somewhat interesting sequence in which a woman is kidnapped and kind of hypnotized. While some of it doesnt make much sense, I could think of explanations for why things happen they way they do, and the odd, distanced, noaffect acting is appropriate to what is going on.Unfortunately distanced characters and noaffect speaking are the rule even after that scene, and puzzling goes to flat out senseless as the movie progresses.The movie is very much a pretentious art film in which the viewer is supposed to do the work of filling in the gaps of the movie. It is full of strange transitions, intercutting between scenes that seem to have nothing to do with one another or between different versions of the same thing. The movie is for people who feel things like story and character development are simple catering to the masses. It is the sort of movie that, if you hate it, you think the people who like it may just be pretending to like it to seem cool, because it is so hard to imagine anyone could genuinely enjoy this. It is a movie that resolutely makes less and less sense as it goes along, so while early on I still thought the elements might somehow be at least vaguely tied together, by the end it appeared that the director himself probably didnt even know how it all connected.This is not to say there are no interesting ideas in the film, because there are a couple. In fact, you could take parts of this movie and make something vaguely interesting out of them. But this movie fails to use its ideas to good effect. It also never connects you to its characters, leaving you alienated and alone in a confused landscape.While the movie looks like a puzzle to be solved, I think it is like the famous riddle from Alices Adventures in Wonderland, Why is a raven like a writing desk, in which when she admits she cannot solve it she is told there is no answer. There is no answer to this movie either, although someone may eventually cobble one together, in the same way that, years later, someone answered the Raven riddle (because Poe wrote on both).The frustrating thing is, I cant stop mulling over what it means, and yes, I am thinking of connections and possibilities. But these connections do not themselves connect. You can make some of this make sense, at least in terms of allegory, but there are always loose ends, like leftover screws in Ikea furniture. And while fans of this movie will watch it over and over, looking for clues, I would never put myself through this again, because the movie is quite boring and just plain tiring to sit through.In looking at reviews, trying to figure out why critics love this movie, I found comments that it was brilliantly and beautifully filmed. I dont understand that reaction. From the first moment I thought it was a flat looking, low budget movie. Competently filmed within its limitations, certainly, but thats about it.I have a friend who will only watch indie films, and after she rejected my first three choices, we settled on this. She soon apologized for rejecting my choices (she kept complaining and apologizing, in fact, until someone in the theater told her to shut up) and promised that next time I could choose the movie.",True

"Excellent, powerful film I loved the film and Im still remembering various scenes from it.  As a victim of a gay hate bashing many years ago when I was 22 which almost killed me, it affected me deeply.The military code of Dont Ask, Dont Tell is stupid.  As was the segretation of blacks and whites in the military until around 1943.  As was the forbidding of interracial marriages in this country in a number of states until 1967.  As was the internment of Asian American citizens during World War II.  As is the antipathy against civil marriage for samesex couples now.  Where is love in all this?  Why is it not even being mentioned?  Love for ones country and for each other.  Barry and Calpernia loved each other.  Whats wrong with that?  When two people love each other and decide to share their lives together, thats a commitment between two people.  Not a commitment with the government or any religion.  They can only acknowledge the commitment in the way each does.  Love doesnt recognize restrictions; its universal.Bigotry kills.  This movie demonstrates that.  Also, back to reality, Ive read the commander (or whatever theyre called) of Fort Campbell who never said a word about the antigay attitude of Fort Campbell at this time was recently promoted.  Now what does that say about our government and the military?I gave the movie a 10.  I only wish I could give more people the same score.",False
"Accurate, intimate and very watchable You could write this off as another story about addiction and the destruction resulting from it, but theres more here. The love story between Ledger and Cornish is a constant throughout, with a great line on how their addiction affects not only their own relationship, but their relationships with others: parents, friends, acquaintances.Abby Cornish is especially good as the art girl turned junkie prostitute; her fall into addiction and the changes it makes in her life are much more effective than Ledgers portrayal of a junkie in love.The parents in the movie are excellent, from subtle facial expressions to dragout fights with their dope fiend daughter. They act much as you would expect parents to act, or at least hope they would act.The ending dropped the ball a little, but maybe they ran out of budget. In any case, I would watch it again. Its realistic, gritty, romantic and a good case study of how drugs can ruin the most intense love.",True
"Dont believe the Hype I may have been more generous with the rating I chose, however due to the overwhelming number of highly positive reviews, I feel that some brutal honesty is required here.The main themes in most of the reviews Ive stumbled across are that this movie has a refreshingly original story and that the car chase scenes were exceptional. Neither circumstance holds true. The story was as cut and dry as any in this genre and the car chase scenes were bland, boring, and made no sense to me. Compared to a movie like Drive, where the protagonists backstory actually lends to his driving skills (stunt car driver, motorsports participant), in Baby Driver, were supposed to believe that some kid somehow acquired exceptional getaway driver abilities because of...tinnitus? There is no connection here, not to me anyway. And as for the chase scenes, utterly boring and unoriginal. The cars were completely lame too. Taking Drive as a point of contention again, the cars in Drive even have some degree of backstory to make the seemingly unbelievable chase scenes more believable...upgraded chassis, suspension, and souped up engines. In Baby Driver, were given nothing more than showroom stock grocery getters...not even the top end models of the cars were chosen to take on the challenges. It was just all around stupid to me and I was left disappointed.OK so the soundtrack was good. But this is not Forrest Gump where a compelling, original story is amplified by a perfectly curated soundtrack. Instead, its a collection of good music used in campy fashion. If what youre after is the soundtrack, get a Spotify account. Dollar for dollar youll get a lot more out of it, I promise.",False
"Absolute masterpiece What can I say? It is an absolute masterpiece in some aspects bringing reminiscences of antic tragedies (in terms of gestures mostly  vide Maria Callas in Pasolinis Medea). But most of all this movie, as almost all Bergmans movies, touches humanity of a man and asks us questions that hardly none of directors was able to present in such a clear manner. The story can be read in many ways, but for me the symbolic one is probably the most fruitful. Persona, the face, mask, in a physical meaning as used in Greek tragedies, the way to become someone else, depict and reenact myths. On higher level, symbolic meaning of persona in Jungs psychology together with all his theories about ego. Simply, a 100% must see for every thinking man.",True
"...and the Academy Award for Best Actor goes to....Daniel Day Lewis!Directed by Steven Spielberg. Starring Daniel Day Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field. Written by Tony Kusher and Doris Kearns Goodwin.I am the president of the United States of America, clothed in immense power! You will procure me those votes!As the Civil War continues to rage, Americas president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield and as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.Steven Spielberg has done it again! It seems like the older he gets, the better his films are! I was very satisfied with his efforts, particularly the set designs and tone. It was a joy to watch. I was not impressed with the cinematography efforts. It was well done but nothing stood out for me. For instance, Scorsese seems to bring a new camera angle/shot/position in every one of his films. I was expecting more.The acting was this films strongest aspect. Daniel Day Lewis brings an historic performance to the screen except I didnt see him in this picture. I saw Abraham Lincoln. He was so driven into the character, at times it was scary. Lewis vision of Lincoln is self confident, calm and patient. It was in my favorite scene that his patience finally wore thin on his colleagues about the negativity in the 13th amendment. The mannerisms were spot on. His efforts match my personal favored work of his in My Left Foot. His best contribution to the picture was consistency. Throughout, he never faltered. His accent never trailed off and his actions were always precise. He is fully deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor. Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field also gave great performances. They brought character and charisma to the picture. I particularly enjoyed the Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field combination. They compliment each other very well. My only criticism of the cast is that there were too many actors. At times, the characters were defined with a tag on the bottom of the screen. I dont enjoy being told in letters who the characters are. I want the character to show me in action who they are.The Score is very well done in this movie. The team of Spielberg and Williams never fails. The music brings just as much emotion to the screen as the actors do. It helps bring the vision and atmosphere to life. This film isnt what I would call a masterpiece but it was a joy to watch. A must see and one of the best films of 2012.",True
"A gem in the heap of garbage called American film Without gushing, I think that this is the best film to come out of the US in several years. This is the type of movie which demands repeated viewing, and reveals itself a little each time. Im surprised that the genius of this film didnt receive more accolades at the time, but I attribute that to the socially acceptable restraints of the mass culture.Absolutely perfect production from top to bottom, makes you laugh out loud... then tears your heart out & puts it back in again. Multi layered & symbolic throughout.Songwriting by Stephen Trask is sublime. But how the hell can a clown like Eminem get an Oscar & this guy was virtually ignored?! Sickening thought. Cameron Mitchell must have been born for this part... a brave & charismatic perf.This movie achieves everything that Velvet Goldmine (yuck) could not... in a fraction of the time.Anyway, anyone whos got a little freak in them will love this movie.

"Theres something about Mr. Brooks all right....This movie was not what I expected, but in a good way. I saw that Kevin Costner was in it, and figured it would be a lighthearted drama. Then I read that it was suspense, and figured he was a goodguy spy or something. Not so.I dont want to spoil exactly what Mr. Brooks is (even though its revealed in the early part of the movie), but lets just say hes not a good guy. He is cold, brilliant, methodical, and heartless. Definitely not the traits we normally expect from Kevin Costner. And yet, its fascinating to watch. I found myself rooting for him, and then had to kick myself because his character is so despicable. Top notch acting from him.Dane Cook seems an odd casting choice for a suspense thriller, and yet he is believable in his role as a cowardly average joe trying to get the better of Mr. Brooks.This movie is surprisingly graphic and brutal in some scenes. Yet it is so engrossing that you will be hooked on every twist and turn (and there are some good ones).Not for the faint of heart, not your normal Costner flick, but a very good movie.",False
"Wait...What?Suburbicon is weird. Like, really weird. And not in a good way. Like drinking coffee out of a beer can thats also spiked with orange juice. And man, is it trying its darndest to make something unique and intentional. Unfortunately, I dont know if Ive ever seen a movie swing so hard and end up whiffing even harder. Suburbicon is not just weird; its also just plain bad. To describe it would be an act of futility. Its sort of about a family dealing with death. Its sort of about racism. Its sort of a mafia comedy. Its sort of a satire of the American dream. Its sort of a familial thriller. It has some great production design, and Oscar Isaac is a blast in his short screen time. Otherwise, its one of the most obnoxious critiques of the dark suburban underbelly Ive ever seen. I have no idea how someone is supposed to plug into this movie. Predictable when trying to be sneaky, dull when trying to be exciting, awkward when trying to be funny; it gives us no character to latch onto, no story to intrigue us, no humor to overcome its darkness, and no clarity or focus to its themes. Honestly, Mr. Clooney, what is this movie? Is it a quirky comedy? Is it a dark thriller? Is it a corny message on love, or a cynical study of American justice? Whatever it is, Ill tell you what it isnt: a movie worth watching.",False
"Yeah, weve seen it all before, but...I have to admit that I have a soft spot for Guy Ritchies mockney gangster films. I dont know what it is. I know that theyre not very profound and have nothing to say, I know that theyre a pure fantasy vision of British crime and I know that if youve seen Lock Stock, youve pretty much seen them all. And yet, as Ritchie returns for a third iteration of the only formula with which hes tasted success , I still find myself walking out of the cinema massively entertained.Rockn Rolla does absolutely nothing new. A quick list of things it shares with Lock Stock and Snatch would read thus: fast paced, witty dialogue; complex, interwoven plot threads; central Mc Guffin driving the mayhem (#1 antique shotguns, #2 huge diamond, #3 a lucky painting); smart, rapid editing; a mountain of Cockney crime stereotypes. Even things such as hardasnails Russian henchmen return. It completes the upward curve of scale in Ritchies crime films: from a rigged card game to a rigged boxing circuit to rigged property development. The crime lords get larger in stature, the sums of money owed have more zeros on the end and the capers required to resolve the situation more grand, but its still the same concept.Youd think this was a list of criticisms, and if you found Snatch wearingly familiar you shouldnt need it spelling out that this film wont impress you. Looking for originality? Look elsewhere. Rockn Rolla may be pushing the formula a little bit, but if you accept that its still enormous fun. Ritchies directing is as proficient as ever, it moves at a merry old pace and the plot just about stays on the rails. The characters are endearing and theres plenty of laughs to be had. Other than its dearth of invention, the only real flaw with the film lies in the opening fifteen minutes, where Ritchie sets up the plot strands which will then unravel. Whereas previous films did this in a smooth, unforced way, here Ritchie lathers it with a liberal helping of voiceover narration so theres absolutely no confusion possible as to who is who and what theyre after, which on many occasions extends to pointing out the bleeding obvious. Show dont tell its the first rule in the book Ritchie! It may be getting to the point where Rockn Rolla must go down as a guilty pleasure, but guilty pleasures are often the most fulfilling kind. And so it is here.",False
"Unforgettable A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.A Canadain Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son & daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. As we follow their search, flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother.There are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in Incendies. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East, this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. It is the third great film (and arguably the best)that Ive seen on this topic after Waltz with Bashir and Lebanon. All of these are essential viewing.",False
"A slice of Valley life that went wrong...real wrong...ALPHA DOG is a film that will resonate with the younger generation as its theme of drugs, rap music and sex can be translated through out the world where a group of teens are angry, ignored and violent. Whether it is the San Fernando valley or the Silicon valley, young men and women with time and money to spend on drink, drugs and sex will find the film is very familiar to their life styles. Sad, but true.The first two acts of the film the dialog is really crude and filthy, and really becomes tiresome, but in relation to young druggies, this is their way of communicating. As an adult, I found it difficult to have any empathy for the young Alpha males except for the brilliant role of Anton Yelchin as Zack. He is so wonderful in his role and captures the innocence of a 15 year old and his final horrifying scenes are ones to remember. And Ben Foster as Zacks brother is sensational in a role that is both powerful and frightening at the same time. I wish this film were one you could find some redemption for, but I felt none at the end and Sharon Stone is once again terrific in a small, but powerful role as the mother. The young cast is awesome and true to the angry youth of today.",False
"Meditative view of life, love, and death by Terrence Malick Badlands, based on the relationship between Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate (and later an inspiration for Tarantinos True Romance and NBK), never has a moment where something unrealistic curries. Writer/producer/director Terence Malick leads his film along with a true emphasis on both the psychological nature of Kit (Martin Sheen) and Holly (Sissy Spacek), and with the uncanny knack for a relaxing style in his camera. At best, Badlands is one of the successful homages to European cinema of the 1970s, something that will last a long time due to its pairing of absorbing arthouse and (perhaps) mainstream sensibilities. At worst, a viewer could feel bored with Malicks intent on running with his poetic ideas as a director. If there was any pretentiousness at all, it went over my head; this is a film that draws you into its tragic nature.Sheen and Spacek are totally believable as a couple on the run, as Kit continually has a triggerhappy attitude to people after he shoots Hollys father. While Spacek holds the heart of the picture steady, Id have to say that Sheens Kit is one of his best performances. He comes off in the perfect sense you wouldnt think for a second that Kit could be a killer, that is until he pulls out his pistol. It works just as well that Holly is the narrator, so that the viewer can understand where Kits coming from, and where hes going. If there is any distance between his character and the audience, theres still a strong, emotional connection through Spacek, and their bond as a loving, if dangerous, couple.Overall, Badlands is extraordinary in a way that doesnt cram its atmospheric from start to finish on the audience, and it looks at young people in love, however in such twisted circumstances, in an honest way in how escalatory events create a disillusioned feeling in youth. That its made on such a low budget gives it more merit. Kudos should go to the musical score by James Taylor, Gunild Keetman and George Tipton, too; its one of the best debuts of the 70s. A+",True
"The reason Robin Williams isnt in a nut house.This is perhaps one of the greatest, funniest parodies in the history of film. I think the greatest definition of irony is that to be believably stupid on screen, you have to be very intelligent. This is a rare occasion where something can be so stupid that its funny, with the addition of feeling you got your moneys worth at the end. Examples of failures would be anchorman, austin powers, scary movie etc. The gore and clichés of three headed, and goofy NI! yelling knights are what give this movie discreet beauty.Did I mention that the acting is also very good for a movie of this sort. All of the main characters, as they do in the series, take on numerous characters, all of whom are well established and each have their quirks about them. This was a well written, well thought out, and perfectly directed, low budget comedy. The funniest of any monty python film, and amongst the top comedies of all time. I laughed from beginning to end and bruised one of my lungs. I highly recommend this film to anyone. This is living proof that all you need is a good script and good actors.",True

Along the way, the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, throws hints of intrigue starting with the title of the film. There are empty pretensions of dressmaking as high art, secret messages sown into dresses and haunting memories. All of this leads to exactly nowhere. Everything Lewis and Krieps do is recorded lovingly and meticulously on film with great mood music in the background. But there is no great reveal, no deep insight into human psyche, no higher truth. In the end it comes down to what a woman wants and what the man can live with. Lewis and Krieps are excellent, especially Krieps, but Lesley Manville as Lewiss sister has the thankless job of looking stern in every scene. Nothing in the film sticks with you when you leave the theater except the dresses, photography and the music; because Anderson has not come up with anything really interesting in the story. Unlike his There Will Blood, which was a great film, Phantom Thread is a phantom film. It is a beautiful ghost of what should have been a really good film. See it if you wish to say goodbye to Daniel Day Lewis, but keep your expectations low.",False
"A superb drama and tribute to those that died that day.On September 11, 2001, four commercial airplanes were successfully hijacked. Three of them hit their target. UNITED 93 is the story of the fourth plane that was successfully thwarted from achieving its goal.Its objective, to hit the White House, was thwarted by a group of individuals that were flying home to San Francisco from Newark on that fateful flight. The plane crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.We know this to be true. But what Writer/Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, Bourne Supremacy) did was take a sensitive and controversial subject and turn it into a drama that is both stunning and powerful. It brings to light the heroic actions taken by the passengers and crew to try and overtake a plane they knew was on a oneway trip to a terrorist act. We get insight of the realtime actions taken by the military, airtraffic and flight control personnel and how they tried in vain to take control of the situation (and ultimately grounding every single plane in flight that day).However well the movie portrayed the crew and passengers, I found the portrayal of one of the hijackers (the pilot) a bit discomforting. Hopefully, Greengrass had some inside knowledge to make the viewer feel some sympathy for him and that it wasnt done just for the sheer entertainment value.United 93 is a serious portrayal and memorial to those whose brave actions saved a Capitol but, unfortunately, was unable to save themselves. As the 5th year anniversary of 9/11 nears, take some time to remember these and the rest of those that died on that terrible day.",True
"One of the most underrated films of the 1990s A lot of people dislike To Die For.  The films detractors largely find fault with its tone and subject matter.  It is really the epitome of black comedy, and anyone expecting either pure comedy or pure suspense will be very disappointed.That said, To Die For deserves a place in film history as one of the sharpest satires of television and fame, ranking alongside films such as Network.  Forgive the cliche, but Nicole Kidmans performance is truly a revelation  she shows talents that were clearly invisible in earlier travesties such as Far & Away and are only now beginning to resurface. But the real discovery in this film is the magnificent Illeana Douglass.  It is scandalous that few people mention her amazing work when discussing To Die For.  If for nothing else, the film should be seen for the work of Kidman and Douglass.  (Note also that To Die For has one of Joaquin Phoenixs earliest roles.)As other commentators here have suggested, you are not guaranteed to love this film.  Nonetheless, as far as Im concerned, its required viewing if youre a film fan.",True
"Excellent What gets me about this film every time I see it is just how simple it is. The witty urbanity of the dialogue goes without saying (hem), the acting is stagily impeccable, and the direction by Hitchcock is limited by the small sets but masterful for all that.Cold Ray Milland plans and sets up the murder of his demure but faithless wife Grace Kelly by a virtual stranger who is urged on by the stick of exposure of his misdeeds and the carrot of GBP1,000 in used notes. Of course all of his convoluted plans go horribly or thankfully wrong, depending on your point of view, leading to an even more convoluted revised plan. When first seen when young I wasted my time because I wasnt paying attention at the critical moment so missed the point and didnt get it: the key is how did the baddie get into the apartment? Its incredibly verbose, being from a stage play after all and at times it seems nothing more than a radio show with pictures. The long scene setting and verbal sparring by Milland and Anthony Dawson is superb to hear  its fascinating for its relentless poetry, and of displaying a nowdead world. I could never understand the attraction of 3D movies, least of all with this particular attempt, or why Kelly was continually uglified by the Hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than in here when she was playing stressed out throughout.I wonder if Hitch remembered the jokey murder scene he did in 1930 in Elstree Calling when Jameson Thomas realised he was murdering in the wrong apartment? Turn that key you have and go in, its a remarkably literate film and as intricate inside as any lock.",False
"Pretensions of art I should be a perfect viewer for this movie. I know and care about the literary world and the characters portrayed in this film. Yet, I found it boring and pretentious.The story telling style, the focus moving from one character to the other, the narration not quite connected to the screen image, the abrupt behaviors, the dizzying camera work and cutting all pointed to a director who wanted to make a showy splash; the jittery techniques of moving the story along overwhelmed the story itself. The tricks are not only not compelling, but they eventually become silly and boring.Since the Philip character is intrinsically unlikeable, you would either have to hate him so much that you watch the movie to see him get his comeuppance or to laugh at him. But Philip is not that hateful and, while his ferocious selfcenteredness might have been quite funny, the Philip character is just NOT funny. All the other characters are inadequately developed, so their self defeating behavior seems mysteriously motivated.The performances are all superior. This actually makes thing worse, as the actors are all saying something of importance is taking place here. This sense of importance is then sabotaged by gratuitous directorial razzledazzle and characters that will never change.Thus, this film is not enlightening, not very funny, and not very interesting.",True
"The best Coens movie, bar none.There are many new movies that have been released on DVD this year. Forget them, and pick up a copy of this movie. It has only recently become available on DVD. The unavailability of this movie on DVD for so many years has been a sin. I own this movie on laser disc and it is one of the reasons that I still have a laser disc player.I cannot do a better job than the other reviewers have in pointing out what make this film so outstanding. Just let me repeat the usual: The casting is flawless; the dialogue is on the mark, with dozens of juicy bon mots; the humor is sublime; the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous; and the plot, while complex, is still comprehensible enough not to detract from the action.This movie is as close to flawless as a movie can be.And one more thing, this movie has nothing in common with either Yojimbo (which was itself a ripoff of Dashiel Hammetts Red Harvest) or Fistful of Dollars. Well, OK, Ill grant that they both take place in towns dominated by two strong gangs of criminals (as if thats never been the case in any other movie,) but the other plot elements and the dialogue are completely original.**** out of ****",False
"Clever intellectual wizardry What if you only realised the importance of your life only days before you lost it? Even knowing when or how you will die (not such a fatuous idea with the completion of the Genome Project) raises difficult questions about how much we really want to know about ourselves.Such a theme is usually simplified and subsumed into religiousbased tales such as Its a Wonderful Life, but taken as an idea in its own right it has considerable intellectual weight. Harold Crick finds himself the main character in a story as it unfolds, but his annoyance quickly shifts gear as he is aware of the author saying, Little did he know . . . it would lead to his imminent death.Not the mindless comedy that the trailer suggests, Stranger Than Fiction is a precise and fairly cerebral story where the laughs stem more from individually appreciating certain aspects of its cleverness rather than any contrived humour. The surface story is of a man who lives a humdrum if successful life and is awakened to a more three dimensional existence by falling in love. The additional elements will either delight or annoy. IRS auditor Crick (Will Ferrell) starts hearing a voice in his head. It is that of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a famous author. She describes exactly what he is doing but with a rather better vocabulary than he possesses. When she announces his imminent death, he takes drastic steps to meet her and persuade her to change the ending of her novel.The characterisation, casting and acting is spoton. Thompson is at her most refreshingly deranged as the harassed and reclusive author. With a literary equivalence of method acting, Eiffel balances on the edge of her desk trying to imagine the thoughts of someone about to make a suicide jump. She sits in the freezing drizzle watching cars cross a bridge to imagine an accident. Her rants at her editorial assistant (who uses more traditional methods of accessing imagination) give a convincing insight into the creative process. While the voice in Cricks head is stereotypical Thompson, the fuller, isolated character, when we meet her, is a minor revelation. I dont need a nicotine patch, she declaims angrily to her assistant. I smoke cigarettes.Maggie Gyllenhaal, as law dropout turned baker Ana Pascal, sparkles, glows and is sexily alluring and radiant with passionate love of life  and she manages to light up the screen faster than, say, even Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. Dustin Hoffman has the least challenging of the main parts, but he endows his character (an eminent professor of literature) with the gravitas needed to take ideas of literary interconnectedness seriously. Will Ferrell gives a remarkable breakout performance in a straight role, reminiscent of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. He is superbly suited to the part as audiences expect him to be a shallow comedy character and here he is trying the find the substantial person inside himself. Most of the audience are concentrating so much on the films intricate hypothesis and how it is worked out, that only afterwards do we realise what a range of emotions Ferrell has to portray with complete seriousness.Novelist Kay Eiffel (Thompson) anthropomorphises things like Cricks watch (similarly the official website says, in real time, As the cursor waited anxiously for the site to load, it couldnt help but feel an overwhelming sense of elation.) We sense a lifeimbuing process that might even be likened to what an actor does with his character; but the film goes a stage further by drawing a similarity with the essentially lifeless, clockwork existence of the IRS auditor whose only escape is discovering love with Pascal. His quest is aided by fictional plot analysis from Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) and of course begs the question, what is fiction?Director Marc Forster showed consummate skill in portraying the positive escapism of JM Barries creative Peter Panwriting in Finding Neverland. With Stranger Than Fiction, he has teamed up with brilliant new dramatist Zach Helm. Helm is fascinated with the writing process in what he calls a larger Post Modern movement. From Pirandello, to Brecht, to Wilder, to Stoppard, to Woody Allen to Wes Anderson, we can see the progression of a contemporary, selfaware, realitybending and audienceinvolving wave in dramatic literature, he says. I love to see Homer Simpson reacting to his creator, Matt Groenig, or the cast of Urinetown complaining from the stage about their own title.Even the street names, business names, and the characters last names of Stranger Than Fiction are significant  Crick, Pascal, Eiffel, Escher, Banneker, Kronecker, Cayly, etc. are all puns on mathematicians who focused on the innate order of things. The invitation is to ask what is beyond the symmetry of things. Stranger Than Fiction meets even its most formidable challenge  making the ending nailbiting and moving after such surreal content. But the ultimate message of the film seems a little trite if it is supposedly coming from a groundbreaking author. Like the glimpses of Eiffels book, we are given impressive mountains of style but little substance. As the film doesnt press the strengths forcefully by admitting in so many words what it is getting at, there is a chance you may not bother with the subtleties  in which case it adds up to very little.A superb testament to inventiveness and worthy of awards in many different categories, Stranger Than Fiction somehow falls short of being a masterpiece.",False
"You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger At The Finish Line Set this time in England, Woody Allen once again invites us into a world of irony and people wanting better than what they have as their present does not fulfill their satisfaction. The title is quite open to interpretation. It gives the impression of the prince charming that straight women fantasize about and dream to end up with. However, there is also another hint which refers to the chaperon who is waiting at the finish line. Rather than exploring, this time Allen just gives us a glimpse into the lives of his key characters. All the characters are in an unfulfilling relationship. Helena (Gemma Jones) is abandoned by Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) and seeks comfort in a prostitute (Lucy Punch) younger than his own daughter. His daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) fantasizes about her boss (Antonio Banderas) while her husband (Josh Brolin) struggles to finish his novel until he peeps at Dia (Frieda Pinto), his neighbour.While many felt the ending to be abrupt, there is a certain irony to it, where the characters who were seeking more than what they had continue to be unsatisfied, while those who were satisfied with what they had and lose it, find that happiness again (like the two idiots at the end). Allens writing is faulty in places. For example, when Roy reveals to Dia how he had been peeping at her through their windows, instead of being concerned or excited, she acts as though his behaviour was that of a gentleman.On the technical side, the film is well shot, in the typical Woody Allen (70s and 80s) fashion. The cinematography and soundtrack are amusing. The sets look polished but not staged.Allen assembles a strong cast. Most of the performances are excellent. Anthony Hopkins, Gemma Jones, Naomi Watts and Lucy Punch own their scenes. Antonio Banderas too shines in a subtle performance and Josh Brolin is great as the selfcentered writer. Freida Pinto was the weakest link. In all fairness, her character suffered from flawed writing.While this may not rank among Allens best work, its still worth a watch especially for those who enjoyed the kind of cinema he made in the 70s and 80s.",False
"One of the ultimate horror classics Every bit of acclaim that Rosemarys Baby has earned is totally deserved. The Dakota, located at 72nd and Central Park West, is the perfect setting for the demonic events; all that rich Gothic detail in the heart of Manhattan provides the perfect atmosphere, serving as a dark fairytale world of its own within the modern setting. Roman Polanski knows this and utilizes it brilliantly, opening the film with stunning aerial shots of the skyline and focusing in on the ornate castle amongst the skyscrapers and tenements.The acting is fantastic, particularly Mia Farrow, who is the only person I can envision as Rosemary. Her fineboned fragility makes her the ideal target for terror. She goes from obliviousness to suspicion to fear to near madness without showing a seam, and we as the audience are with her all the way. And Mia is given a run for her money by the delightful Ruth Gordon, a comical yet sinister presence popping in on a deliberate schedule with pale green drinks and sandpapery advice. Shes scary because we know hera batty old broad with a seemingly sweet nature beneath her caustic surface. That such a person could possibly be a vessel of evil is a thoroughly unnerving concept.Unnerving is the proper adjective for the entire movie. Unnerving, eerie, and penetratingly frightening in a very subtle manner. The subtlety is key, since a more explicit treatment wouldve spoiled everything. As the tension heightens, we feel what Rosemary feels: Curiosity, then vague suspicion, then paralyzing terror at the final revelation. At all times, the movie retains its dignity, from the opening and closing shots of the building to the flourishing title script to the beautiful music. Even on TV, this picture can chill you to the bone. The best bigbudget horror movie of all time.",True
"practically the definition of a mustsee movie I have heard people describe Spike Lee as a secondrate filmmaker; all I have to say is that secondrate filmmakers do not make films like this. Do the Right Thing is a masterpiece in both style and substance, and Im hard pressed to think of a more powerful, earthshattering film.But first, lets talk about the style. The color palette of the movie is wonderful; while its mostly deep reds, they manage to bring home the feeling that the residents of Bed Stuy must have been feeling on that day. The cinematography is excellent... it features a lot of weird viewpoints and angles, but they are used to great effect and manage to work within the style of the film. One thing that really managed to impress me about the film is the razor sharp dialogue... each character has their own style of talking, and it really works well. This is a masterfully written film.
Now the substance... this movie manages to spiral into a truly spectacular ending. Throughout, its easy to see the necessary elements building, and, when it happens, it hardly seems like a surprise, but that doesnt make it any less shattering. The way that each character acts defines this movie throughout, especially at the end! Spike Lee does a brilliant job here. The movie is interesting and wellmade throughout; each of the characters are threedimensional and feel like real human beings  their motivation is understood throughout. Do the Right Thing is a brilliant movie that never lags and never lets up. It manages to be vastly entertaining and vastly powerful at the same time. Its truly an amazing achievement in film, and its a shame it was not recognized more for its obvious brilliance when it was released in 1989.",False
"Rattling and shocking.Late last night I was watching Foxtel and I came across Song For A Raggy Boy. This movie shook me so hard that I could cry at the drop of a hat. I have no idea why this movie would rattle me more than most other movies I have seen recently  there are far more graphic and shocking movies than this. But the cruelty of the violence coupled with the students passion and hope (as well as the inspiring school teacher) left me to turn off the TV and sit in complete darkness for what felt like hours, literally trembling.Also, as a result, I shall forever look upon Ian Glen as The Sadist Headmaster Who Thrashed The Kids Senseless. He was almost TOO good in this role. Aidan Quinn, however, has proved himself once again to be a fine actor, worthy of much more acclaim than he has received. Hes not an Alister, by any means, but he has an art, an impeccably developed craft. He blew me away in Two Of Us and...well, if I wore a hat, id take it off to you.",False
"Silly, but lighthearted caper Footloose is a fun and very lighthearted motion picture that promises a good time and delivers.The film has a simple, if unlikely, plotline.  Streetsmart but gentle teenager Ren Mac Cormack(Kevin Bacon) arrives from the big city with his mother in the backwater town of Bomont.  Enrolling at the local high school, he is appalled to discover the towns adults have imposed a law on public dancing and rock music, as enforced and practiced by the local preacher(John Lithgow).  Ren quickly sets about changing things, falling in love with the preachers daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) in the process.The story is a little unlikely yet it is perfectly suitable for the teenaged audience at which it is pitched.  The script takes some time to explore its simple theme  dancing and rock music, and what they symbolise for young people.  Three scenes help to lay this out.  The first sees Ren dancing by himself in a barn; the town meeting where Ren presents his case to the townspeople and explains to them the meaning of the dance; and the final prom sequence in which the teens of Bomont revel in their newfound liberation.As the leading man, Kevin Bacon carries off his role very well.  Ren isnt really a macho hero revelling in coolness, hes a downtoearth young man trying to the right thing by his peers.  His romance with Lori Singers character Ariel is formulaic but perfectly inoffensive.
The film could have perhaps done with a little more nastiness to fully contrast against Rens earnest intentions.  Even Ariels brutish boyfriend(Jim Young) fails to inject much tension in this respect and the final fistfight between him and Ren comes across as being a bit lame.John Lithgows characterisation is very good but it is a little too subtle. As the town Reverend and preacher of all things pure and holy, his extreme views come across not so much as puritanical, just merely uptight.  The change that eventually occurs in his attitudes is hinted at very early on. The result is that he is nowhere near is frightening or intimidating a character as he could have been.  At the same time his troubled relationships with his rebellious daughter and quiet wife(Dianne Wiest) are very well written and acted.  In these scenes he excels and his characters development seems very natural.On the technical side, the film is wellshot and the gloriously Eighties soundtrack complements the proceedings very well, bringing the necessary exhuberance and bounce to the whole movie.Whilst Footloose is certainly no masterpiece, it succeeds in being a lighthearted knockabout caper, and as such is a very enjoyable movie.",False
"The Hangover becomes Mission Impossible Not so long ago in the year 2009, The Hangover exploded onto the scene and was praised as one of the funniest films of the decade, with its witty cast and the hilarious retracing our footsteps to find out what we did routine running as the main plot. The Hangover Part II simply changed nothing at all, and offered nothing new with the attitude of if it aint broke, dont fix it. What will please fans the most with The Hangover Part III, is that is does not follow the same formula that the first two did. However, a lot of fans will be headed into disappointment when they realize that this third instalment decides to take a completely different change in direction than that of its predecessors. And by completely, I mean very much drastically.The story follows the Wolf Pack yet again as they try to help Alan (Zach Galifianakis) get back on track due to him being off his meds, and soon enough they get thrown into a Mission Impossibleesque mission to save their friend Doug (Justin Bartha, who yet again takes a miss on all the excitement) from Marshall (John Goodman), an angry gangster who wants the Wolf Pack to find Chow (Ken Jeong, who has a much larger screen time in this instalment) and return to him to them with 21 million dollars in gold bricks that he stole. If not, Doug gets the offing. A major plot point is the development of Alan. His friends Phil and Stu (Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms) are mature and grown men who have happily settled down, but he is still very much stuck as a spoilt rotten teenager within a mans body, and his life is going nowhere. Throughout the adventure, it really is a tale about Alan and watching him grow into the man he should have become years ago. Fans of The Hangover owe it to themselves to watch it, whatever their final opinion of it may be.Whereas The Hangover Part III doesnt match the quality of its first part, it definitely doesnt deserve all the negativity it has been getting. The film does a good job of balancing the well known Hangover humour with the Mission Impossibleesque set pieces, and all the recurring stars do well reprising their roles. One of the biggest changes that The Hangover Part III entails is that there is no actual drinking/hangover sequence. Theres also no wedding or no missing person (or a pot smoking monkey). Instead, it plays it much straighter and it knows what it wants to set out to do, which is to stray far away from the formula of the first two chapters. And by doing so, it makes the finale to The Hangover Trilogy one to remember.My Verdict: The Hangover Part III is a fitting end to the trilogy, but despite its changes in directions fans will be divided, resulting in a love or hate for this final chapter.",False
"A Decent Satire We are drawn in by interesting, unique storyline and smart satirizations. About a man whose unique job is to fly around the country to inform people that they are fired. He meets a young ambitious woman that joins his company and who wants to change the system. Her ideas clash with his personal lifestyle choices.What the movie really is about is lifestyle choices, and relationship choices, choosing independence and freedom versus commitment and well established interpersonal relationships. By taking a definitive stance the movie provides interesting commentary on those that for whatever reason (not necessarily for work) dont stay put. A Monotone mood is established, that gave a bland aspect as though nothing substantial was happening. Part of the story took a dull meandering at times, however there were unconventional plot twists that made something that was seemingly Hollywood predictable not that way at all. And it was still interesting and entertaining to watch the contemporary witticisms. The two main characters, although not the most true to life characters ever created, were brilliant satires of people we all know. We are all too familiar with the fiercely independent, noncommittal, cockily at ease bachelor and we have also come across the, sharp, type A, ivy league know it all yet with an obvious naivety especially shown with her declaration of the specific laundry list of traits that her partner must have. There were also some smart satirical illustrations of contemporary times in business, relationships, how people interact and the recession. For example the use of the smart phones in the new techno/relationship world is not simply put in as a momentum mechanism but is used as a symbol to satirize contemporary society. It is not so much Clooneys acting that is a marvel as the casting, which was perfect. By being so spot on by choosing someone on the cusp of getting a little older yet with plenty of playful, youthful vigor we sense the conflict and the melancholy.",False
"A road movie with a difference Away We Go (2009), directed by Sam Mendes, is a road movie with a difference. Many road movies involve strangers met by the protagonist as he or she travels from place to place. Away We Go sends the two main characters into different locations, but all the people they meet are people they already know, or think they know.When Verona De Tessant (Maya Rudolph) learns that she is pregnant, the question for her and her partner, Burt (John Krasinkski) is, Where do we live after the baby is born? To answer the question, they travel from distant (U.S. and Canadian) city to distant city. Mostly what they find is disappointment and bad surprises.Lily (Allison Janney), a former boss and friend, proves to be a dysfunctional person raising a dysfunctional family. A cousin, LN (Maggie Gyllenhaal) gives new meaning to the words New Age. Veronas sister Grace (Carmen Ejogo) has her own problems and heartaches.There are jokes (and laughs) along the way, but, the trip gets more and more discouraging (for them and us) as the movie goes along. What saves Verona and Burt (and the movie) is the loving, caring, and realistic relationship between the couple. Theyre both interesting, quirky, and attractive people. We care for them, and we want their quest to succeed.Both Janney and Gyllenhaal are outstandingas expectedalthough Mendes has portrayed both their characters in an exaggerated, overthetop fashion. Thats O Kwe get the point, and the movie is a work of fiction, not a documentary.Maya Rudolph makes a smooth transition from TV (SNL) to film. Shes not dropdead beautiful in the Hollywood style, which makes her more attractive (to me) and more appropriate to the character she plays.Burts character is more problematic. Hes supposed to be someone who sells insurance to insurance companies, but he looks and dresses more like an assistant manager at a fast food restaurant. (He goes to a job interview dressed like someone who has picked out his clothing at a thrift shop.) And, given his moderate success in business, and Veronas equally moderate success as a medical illustrator, theyre amazingly casual about spending money. Are they using their lifes savings? All in all, this is a movie worth seeing, but not likely to be on anyones list of alltime favorite movies. We saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It would also work well on DVD.",True
"A Facisnating True Story with Gritty Realism and Excellent Performances One of the best films Ive seen this year! A raw, gritty, and incredible true story about a HIV diagnosed man who went to extraordinary lengths to survive at a time when the AIDS epidemic was at its worst.Matthew Mc Conaughey who lost a significant amount of weight to play the role gives the performance of his career along with Jared Leto whos equally as good here. The two give quite possibly the best performances Ive seen in a film all year in which I actually forgot I was watching actors in a film and instead felt as if I was watching real people. Theres no doubt they will both receive nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.While this kind of story does feel a bit familiar overall, its excellent screenplay and sense of realism along with the excellent performances make up for it. While its defiantly not easy viewing and a bit of a downer to watch, its a truly inspiring (and important) true story and one of the years best films.Mc Conaughey has been made out to be a bit of a laughing stock after starring in a series of really mediocre films. His recent performances however, have shown that the man truly is one of the best actors working in the business right now. Dallas Buyers Club is only further proof of this.",True
"Selective look at the life and times of Bobby Fischer: Bobby has problems.... So did Mozart Pawn Sacrifice (2015 release; 115 min.) is a fictional biopick about chess legend Bobby Fischer. As the movie opens, we get archive TV news footage from a bunch of different countries with the shocking news that Bobby Fischer did not show up for Game 2 of the Chess World Championship, as we see Fischer holed up in his room, refusing to come out. We then go back to 15 November 51, Brooklyn, NY, where we meet 8 yr. old Bobby, growing up with his mom. We already see his mind getting restless quickly, but also starting to astonish with his chess moves. At this point were maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when I herd earlier this year that a movie was being made about the life and times of Bobby Fischer, and that it was directed by none other than Edward Zwick (the director of Glory and Defiance, among others), I was pretty excited about it. Alas, it was not to be. What I thought would be a biopick on Fischers life, turns out to be a very selective look instead. The movies focus is clearly, and almost to the exclusion of everything else, on the 1972 World Championship against Boris Spassky. Yes, we do get a few glimpses of the younger Fischer. Fischers mental problems do not get examined indepth but are dealt with hastily. Bob has problems comments Father Lombarty, to which someone responds So did Mozart, and end of story. Most disappointing for me was that the film essentially stops with Fischers win in 1972. The remaining 36 years of his life, which remain clouded in mystery for a good part, are dismissed in about 2 minutes at the end of the movie. The leading acting performances, with Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky, are quite good, but keep your eye out as well for upandcoming Canadian actress Évelyne Brochu in the role of Donna, Fischers very first girlfriend (when he already was in his 20s). If you are interested in a more indepth look at the life and times of Bobby Fischer, Id readily recommend the excellent 2011 documentary Bobby Fischer Against The World.Pawn Sacrifice opened this weekend on five screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. I was eager to see it. The matinée screening where I saw this at today turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. I cant imagine that this movie will stick around for more than a couple of weeks in the theater. I encourage you to check out Pawn Sacrifice for yourself, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Bluray, and draw your own conclusions.",False
"Timeless magic of warped genius.Most films age over time. In 20 years will Titanic still be as amazing as it was in 1998? Will Jurassic Park still have people gawping open mouthed at the cinema screen? I think not. Its a rarity, but sometimes, just sometimes, there comes a movie that is timeless, magical and eternal, one such film is Alice in Wonderland.It seems to me, when watching most Disney films, that Walt Disney had an evil masterplan to mess with the minds of children, young and old. Dumbo is a film about an outsider, Pinocchio is a film about a freak child who cannot stop lying. Walt only made these films family viewing through constantly having a moral ending. Dumbo can fly and Pinocchio is rewarded for risking his life to save another, however, these moral endings do not disguise the fact that, at times, Disney films were quite peculiar.Alice in Wonderland on the surface is a dreamlike fantasy about a child nodding off and visiting a wonderful wonderland where flowers sing, caterpillars smoke and rabbits talk. However, similarly to Blue Velvet, this film is not about the surface values, its is about the dark, seedy undertones that exist beneath the aesthetic surface.Below its surface lies a wealth of wholly unlikeable and unhelpful creatures. Aside from the King (Hooray) of Hearts, each character only serves to hinder Alice in her attempts to come to terms with her warped dream. The Cheshire Cat is responsible for putting Alice in court, the White Rabbit wants to have Alice destroyed when he finds her at his home, the flowers shun Alice when they incorrectly perceive her to be a common garden weed, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare also shun Alice for no reason whatsoever, this list is as long as the tunnel that leads Alice into her Wonderland.To look back at the film nowadays, one could surmount that the ending is nothing more than a copout (these thoughts were true for Lynchs Boxing Helena). She dreamt it all along is nothing more than saying, here, well give you licence to create a magical world, no boundaries because it all exists inside a young girls mind.Ill admit this review might seem overly critical of the film, but it is for these warped reasons and the context of what the film represents or least what it should represent that I absolutely adore it. Walt Disney might have had a masterplan to screw with the minds of his children, but I say, good luck to him. A subtle undertone to the magical shell of the movie shows that the yolk is in fact sour. I darent but will compare this movie to Adrian Lynes Jacobs Ladder, another film about a false surface level and the warped undertones of life and death.Sleep is only a state of mind, its what happens in this state of mind that really matters.

Its about the developing friendship between Al (Nick Cage) and Birdy (Matthew Modine), but its also about a descent into madness, and the lengths to which Al goes for his friend.The film starts in the late 60s, in a US military mental hospital. Cage has been seriously wounded, and has had reconstructive surgery on his face, but hes been brought in because Birdy is here. Hes uncommunicative and appears to recognise no one, spending all day squatting on the floor of his cell squinting up at the window.The story is mostly told in flashbacks, either Al recounting incidents in their growing friendship as neighbourhood kids or, later, Birdy remembering other incidents. From the start the two are pretty dissimilar  Al is athletic, outgoing and popular while Birdy is quiet and introverted  a typical nerd. The two are, paradoxically, brought together by Birdys love of birds, and the stupid things they do  making suits out of pigeon feathers to befriend more pigeons, climbing on (and falling off) factories trying to capture more birds.Al tries to set Birdy on a normal track; they buy a wrecked car and fix it up, and head off to the beach. But Birdy is just too wrapped up in himself for this to work, and its a wonder he doesnt alienate Al with his strange behaviour.In the present, the doctor is putting more pressure on Al to get Birdy to respond; if he doesnt, then Birdy will be written off and sent to a permanent mental institution. The flashbacks continue, and it becomes clear that Birdys love of birds has turned into an obsession, and then into the darker realms beyond that.The final few minutes of the film cover a lot of ground; Al finally realises that Birdy is pretty well off the deep end; they both go off to fight in the war; Al gets his injury, while we see the incident that left Birdy in his present state. Meanwhile the doctor finally decides that time has run out, but Al decides hes not leaving.The ending of the film is incredibly powerful, and it should be a criminal offence to give it away. Is it appropriate to the rest of the film? I dunno  but I thought it was pretty damn good.The film stands or falls on the performances of Cage and Modine  and, for me, it stands tall. Cage is excellent in his role, capturing the bravado of his character perfectly; but Modine is simply brilliant. During the flashbacks he portrays his nerdy character completely believably, but its the way he handles the scenes in the asylum that amazed me. As soon as you know his obsession, it is crystal clear that hes not squatting in his cell, but perching, wishing to fly.Alan Parker has made some great films; this might just be his best.",False
"Feels like watching a movie length montage I had virtually no expectations for this movie other than a trailer I had seen.Turns out the entire movie is like a trailer. The whole movie was a series of jumpcuts from scene to scene. There were a ton of montages of Cruise flying, smuggling, etc. It felt like the movie tried to hard to not get bogged down in details, but as a result I found the movie hard to connect with. It didnt help that Cruises character doesnt have much of a persona. He likes to fly and has questionable morals (such as being willing to smuggle drugs) but there is not much there beyond that. I think they wanted to show that he loved his family but he made so many questionable decisions that put them at risk that it was hard to like his character. Plus some people have described this as a comedy but it totally lacked any laugh out loud moments or even internal chuckles.I feel like this story could have been better told with more of a cohesive story line, rather than having Cruise montage his way through it all. It felt like a 2 hour trailer to me. I gave 5 stars because the movie is somewhat entertaining, but I feel like it fell short of its potential and I wouldnt watch it a 2nd time.",False
"Elvis the movie is the king baby!I remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland, it all came flooding back. Why this hasnt had a Video or DVD release yet? Its sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been. In fact this is the one John Carpenter film that hasnt been released. In fact i havent seen it on the TV either since the day i watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role he was born to play. John carpenters break from horror brought this gem that id love the TV to play again. It is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes. Belting out most of Elviss greatest hits with gusto. I think this also was the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big trouble in little china, and Escape from L.A. Someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life, which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has. If this doesnt get released then we are gonna be in Heartbreak Hotel.",True
"A masterpiece from the greatest era of American cinema.There are people who have seen this movie that have not been stoked by it (see some user comments). Personally I cant understand this. I know that there are people who have different tastes, and maybe some younger viewers will not be able to relate to it, or appreciate it. However, at the risk of sounding like a dick, I can confidently say that those are people I would not want to know anyways. This is a film that does what great films are supposed to do; that is to transcend our daily lives and bring us joy. There are a few films that can be called masterpieces because all the different film elements that are brought together have a unique quality and vision and the final result is something more special than the sum of the elements themselves. In a nutshell, this is a simple story about a young Italian Brooklyn man, Tony Manero, from humble roots with a gift for dancing who dreams of something better against all odds. He escapes from it all out on the dance floor, basking in the glow of the disco ball, and the frivolous, moving dance music. He meets another young woman at the danceclub, Stephanie Modano, played by an underrated Karen Lynn Gorney, who is equal to him in dance ability, and, more importantly, in desiring a better life. The two struggle together, and against each other, in their pursuit of winning a dance contest that may spur on their dreams.A simple story yes. One youve seen before yes. But after that, there is no other film that can touch it. John Travolta, as Tony, was in his prime, giving a performance that is so likeable because he is so normal. Who cant relate to a character who is so honest, so cool, so goofy, so conflicted; who has talent but doesnt get recognized by the people who should recognize him, like his family, only by his friends whom he knows deep down are all creeps? This is all of us!The soundtrack features some of the best disco music ever made, in terms of making you feel joyous, and impervious to the worlds problems. Mostly contributed by The Bee Gees, as well as others, it is the essential element that makes the whole thing work.John Badhams direction is even; giving the audience plenty of music and show stopping musical bits, yet unafraid to lure you back to the grim reality of what our hero is always up against. But its never heavy handed. The story is equal parts dramatic, comedic, exhilirating, and pensive, and moves along just as rhythmically as the music.In the end, literally as well as figuratively, Tony is more alone and unsure than ever in his ever changing world. And so it makes sense that he reaches out to Stephanie for love and support; someone that has at least a little understanding of who he really is, even if they cant be lovers. Simple, realistic, beautiful. The 70s was the true golden age of American cinema. It was the era of the auteur. Great minds like Scorsese, Coppola, Lucas, Spielberg, Badham, and so forth had for a decade or so, the ability to make truly visionary films; in the sense that they had a lot of creative power to express themselves devoid of studio pressure, political correctness, marketing tieins, and big budget, sensory offending, special effects. They laid it on the line. And we get to enjoy it for eternity.Attention younger viewers, dont let the distorted lingering stereotype fool you. This isnt a cheesy film with John Travolta dancing like a clown to music that sucks. It is as good a film as youll see, if you can allow yourself to appreciate it as a real film. Disco music was once cutting edge before it sucked. John Travolta was actually a good dancer and actor, and the story really does have depth.",False
"An amazing third Story Lee Unkrinch directed Toy Story 3, the third and presumably final installment in the Toy Story movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999s Toy Story 2 remains my personal favorite of the three), and I wont argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto Toy Story 2 for deep personal reasons, but Toy Story 3 does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch  a rarity in animated films these days.As foreshadowed in Toy Story 2, Andy (John Morris) has finally grown up; hes 17 now, and is on his way to college in just a few days. His mom is putting pressure on him to get rid of his old toys, either by throwing them out with the garbage, donating them to other needy children, or simply putting them in the attic (a sort of gonebutnotforgottenandwithinreachtype of deal).Woody (Tom Hanks), brave leader of the toys and Andys favorite, manages to dodge a bullet somewhat, but puts himself in the line of fire when Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at Sunnyside Daycare, where they are welcomed with open arms by the resident toys there. This introduces us to Lotso (Ned Beatty), the strawberryscented teddy bear who runs the place, along with the metrosexual Ken doll (Michael Keaton) and others. As it turns out, this daycare center is actually a prison, and Lotso runs this place with an iron fist; of course, Lotso has a very tragic backstory that explains his evil ways, much like with Jessie (Joan Cusack), who first appeared in Toy Story 2. So Woody and the other toys must mount a valiant escape if they are to be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves for college.Toy Story 3 is an amazing film, and a fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first Toy Story, which also signaled the arrival of the very illustrious and extremely talented Disneyowned animation studio Pixar. They have yet another significant hit on their hands with this picture. The animation here is at its most lifelike and real and its damnnear flawless and strikingly beautiful, which signals just how far Pixar has come in the 15 years since their first hit with Toy Story. And every film since then has added significant amounts of realism, weight, and dimension to their animated stories.While Toy Story 2 had a high nostalgia factor for days long gone by, Toy Story 3 is a film about the inevitability of children growing up and putting away their toys. There are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here. In addition, Toy Story 3 can also be an incredibly dark film at times  a bold move considering that this is a family film  but theres no need to worry because the fact is that its all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very lighthearted humor, fast and furious action scenes, and stirring emotional moments that just might bring a few tears to your eyes.Toy Story 3 is a triumph of animation and imagination, and I say that as a diehard Toy Story 2 fan. What we get here, is a fitting closer (?) to an amazing film series that just continues to surprise again and again with each new entry. Its just a great reminder for all of us heartless adults of better days in our youth that have long gone byebye.10/10",False
"Thoroughly Thornton!A magnificent film! Watching Billy Bob, I was reminded of Bo Radley (Robert Duvall)in To Kill a Mockingbird. The irony of seeing Duvall in Sling Blade made it that much more rewarding. Yes, its true, the ending was inevitable, but so what? The journey to the end was what made this film the gem that it is. Dwight Yoakam made my skin crawl, and Lucas Black as little Frank brought out my motherhood instinct. Protect that boy, Karl! And he did. This had all the elements of a great film: an unselfish hero who brings about changes in the lives of others in a meaningful way. Granted, had his mental capabilities been greater he might have made another choice. Given the circumstances of the film, there was no other choice.",False
"Stunning depiction of a gross miscarriage of justice This is an extraordinary documentary in which film maker Errol Morris shows how an innocent man was convicted of murdering a policeman while the real murderer was let off scot free by the incompetent criminal justice system of Dallas, Texas. The amazing thing is that Morris demonstrates this gross miscarriage of justice in an utterly convincing manner simply by interviewing the participants. True, he reenacts the crime scene and flashes headlines from the newspaper stories to guide us, but it is simply the spoken words of the real murderer, especially in the coldblooded, explosive audio tape that ends the film, that demonstrate not only his guilt but his psychopathic personality. And it is the spoken words of the defense attorneys, the rather substantial Edith James and the withdrawing Dennis White, and the wrongfully convicted Randall Adams that demonstrate the corrupt and incompetent methods used by the Dallas Country justice system to bring about this false conviction. Particularly chilling were the words of Judge Don Metcalfe, waxing tearyeyed, as he recalls listening to the prosecutors summation about how society is made safe by that thin blue line of cops who give their lives to protect us from criminals. The chilling part is that while he is indulging his emotions he is allowing the cop killer to go free and helping to convict an innocent man. Almost as chilling in its revelation of just how perverted and corrupt the system has become, was the report of how a paid psychologist, as a means of justifying the death penalty, interviewed innocent Randall Adams for fifteen minutes and found him to be a danger to society, a bloodthirsty killer who would kill again.This film will get your dander up. How the cops were so blind as to not see that 16yearold David Harris was a dangerous, remorseless psychopath from the very beginning is beyond belief. He even took a delight in bragging about his crime. As Morris suggests, it was their desire to revenge the cop killing with the death penalty that blinded them to the obvious. They would rather fry an innocent man than convict the real murderer, who because of his age was not subject to the death penalty under Texas law. When an innocent man is wrongly convicted of a murder three things happen that are disastrous: One, an innocent man is in jail or even executed. Two, the real guilty party is free to kill again. And, three, the justice system is perverted. This last consequence is perhaps the worst. When people see their police, their courts, their judges condemning the innocent and letting the guilty walk free, they lose faith in the system and they begin to identify with those outside the system. They no longer trust the cops or the courts. The people become estranged from the system and the system becomes estranged from the people. This is the beginning of the breakdown of society. The Dallas cops and prosecutors and the stupid judge (David Metcalfe), who should have seen through the travesty, are to be blamed for the fact that David Harris, after he testified for the prosecution and was set free, did indeed kill again, as well as commit a number of other crimes of violence.The beautiful thing about this film is, over and above the brilliance of its artistic construction, is that its message was so clear and so powerful that it led to the freeing of the innocent Randall Adams. Although the psychopathic David Harris, to my knowledge, was never tried for the crime he committed, he is in prison for other crimes and, it is hoped, will be there for the rest of his life. Errol Morris and the other people who made this fine film can pride in these facts and in knowing that they did a job that the Dallas criminal justice system was unable to do.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Cant Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

"Absolutely fascinating Director Richard Linklater follows one slacker after another in this absolutely fascinating film.  Linklater throws out the rules of traditional moviemaking with this lowbudget film shot in Austin, Texas.  There is no star, in fact, there is no central character.  The camera simply follows one person, who meets and relates to a second person, then follows the second person to a third person and so on.  Although the structure appears aimless, it remains thematically in focus throughout, and the film introduces enough interesting characters to fill five movies.  The only problem is the length. By the end, the novelty starts to wear off a little bit.",False
"The horror! The horror!Id be hardpressed to name any film Ive watched that is as strange and disturbing as The Act of Killing (brought to you by executive producers Werner Herzog and Errol Morris).When Indonesian president Sukarno allied himself with communists in 1965, he was toppled by a military coup and a bloody, anticommunist purge followed. Ethnic Chinese, deemed disproportionately wealthy and corrupt by other Indonesians, were targeted as well – or at least this is how some pretended to justify the genocide of so many innocents. A million people were killed. The same paramilitary death squads that carried out the assassinations are politically strong today and count with government ministers among their members. They proclaim themselves national heroes and boast loudly about their achievements. Director Joshua Oppenheimer interviews some of these gangsters and invites them to reenact the murder scenes by adapting them to their favorite movie genres (Westerns, musicals, etc.) I initially wondered whether such a bizarre concept wasnt disrespectful to the victims of the massacre, but I realized that it was precisely this format that enabled the director to revisit history and unearth its truth. Oppenheimer had to stroke the gangsters egos or he would have never been allowed to film. Some of them, including the main character, Anway, started their criminal careers by scalping tickets at a local cinema and were big fans of Hollywood films. In an article from The Australian newspaper, Oppenheimer explains the documentarys theatrical approach this way: Killing always involves some kind of distancing from what you are doing. Maybe that always means a kind of performance and acting, some kind of storytelling. Maybe it can just mean drinking first. But for Anwar, in part, it comes from the stories that he would imbibe in the cinema, the images and roles, the process of cinematic identification. The act of killing, for Anwar, was always some kind of act. The result is both chilling and surreal. It is shocking to see these men proudly celebrating their monstrous crimes, including rape. Have they no empathy? How ignorant, demented and evil can humans be? This reminds me of the BBC documentary miniseries The Nazis: A Warning Story, in which former Nazi members speak coldly about their ideology, indifferent to the suffering they have caused. These Indonesian gangsters, however, are still in power and are applauded on national TV, their insanity still shared decades later by a significant portion of the population.There seems to be a disconnect between these people and their feelings, as if all the violence had somehow rendered them numb. This is most evident in Anwar. While a few of the thugs express some awareness of the harm they have done, Anwar is in a state of denial. He blocks his emotions and appears to bury any remorse for his acts under a fabricated storyline that absolves him. Yet, toxic memories stubbornly surface every night in the form of nightmares. As the film goes on, he slowly wakes up from the cloud of illusion that he has created around him and realizes the horror that hes participated in. This is one of the films big successes.Its frightening to picture this kind of cruelty emerge from a marginal, uneducated, thirdworld environment. But we have to ask ourselves how different we are from them. Dont we turn a blind eye on the killing of civilians carried out by drones in other countries, for example? Dont we also glorify national heroes who wiped out entire populations? As a Venezuelan, I think of the revered Independence leader Bolivar, who ordered the systematic murder of all Spanish civilians with his decree of War to the Death. Every country has its stories. We seem to rationalize these inconvenient facts by telling ourselves that the war was merciless on both sides or that the end somehow justifies the means. Like gangster Adi suggests, history is written by the victors and war crimes are defined by the winners.At two and a half hours long, the film could use a little more editing, in my opinion. I feel like it would be even more effective if it were stripped down further, removing any hints of sensationalism. Im confused, for example, as to why Herman, the obese gangster, is dressed in drag during each reenactment. Did he find it comical? Was he aiming for the grotesque? Did he do it out of his own initiative or did the filmmakers encourage this? It gives the impression that someone was trying hard to make things look even weirder, which is completely unnecessary. Maybe theres a good explanation for this. And then again, everything in this film is so bizarre that it often resembles a work of pitchblack satire. Its terrifying strangeness, however, is no joke.",False
"Perhaps too ambiguous, but certainly interesting Safe is perhaps a tad too ambiguous for its own good. The film focuses on a suburban housewife (Julianne Moore) who feels sick for no reason. Her doctor suggests psychological treatment, but she finds more comfort in the idea that her sickness is caused by environmental factors, such as car fumes and the like. Haynes never answers the question of what is really affecting Moore. One moment youre sure its psychological, then physical symptoms displayed by the woman are undeniable. Its not that I really wanted the questions answered, but the constant toying with the audience does become a strain, especially as the film runs for two hours and not much happens. Theres also the possibility that the story isnt meant to represent reality, but instead it might be allegorical. This makes it all the more difficult to unravel. I know I sound sort of negative in this review, but I did like it. I dont think it works completely, but I found it fascinating. One reason it does work at all is that Haynes major goal seems to want to put us inside Moores head. It shows us what it would be like to suffer and not know why, and how comfortable it might be to, say, join a cult, which is basically what she does in the end. Not entirely satisfying, but definitely well worth a look.",True
"Open a bottle of red, sit back....and enjoy.Although I truly love watching this entire cast in other movies, I recorded this on my DVR for one reason only: Hiroyuki Sanada. And Im so glad I did. A long time fan of Ivory/Merchant films, I expected a story to unfold beautifully and it definitely does here. Its soft, subtle, realistic, and warm. Its like spending an evening in front of a cozy fire with good company. Nothing is over acted, theres no fancy effects or crazy cinematography, just good, solid storytelling with an absolutely perfect cast. These are the films Hollywood should aspire to. Ive had enough of 3D action and fantasy films for awhile. So please, watch this and remember why we fell in love with film.",True
"Surprised that it was so good I read the reviews of this film and decided it was worth a punt. I have to say that although I was in Manchester during the 1970s I was not a fan of Punk music. This film is beautifully made  almost like a 1950/60s kitchen sink film of the gritty north (there are worse places than Macclesfield, believe me!). I dont know Joy Divsions work but the acting in this film by the major players was excellent. Sam Riley as Curtis is very very good as is Samantha Morton as his downtrodden wife. I thought the guy who played the manager was a bit OTT. What a shame that Tony Wilson died before this was released. My reaction to it was much like the one I had to Trainspotting. I was convinced that I wouldnt like it but came away feeling that this was a very important film. Even if you dont know Punk music or Joy Division  go along. Well worth it.",False
"A Powerfully Understated Piece Of Filmmaking For a film with such a haunting and depressing scenario, Beginners is a surprisingly powerful and perceptive piece of cinema. When I first read the synopsis, I was a bit doubtful about the concept and was uncertain as to whether it was worth a watch, however after learning that the film was partially autobiographical and based on the life of writerdirector Mike Mills, I decided to give it a try, convinced by the inspiration of Mills firstperson experiences. Beginners blends comedy and romance against a dramatic backdrop in order to create a charming and characterdriven story. In my opinion, it is Christopher Plummers Oscarwinning performance that really sells the picture accompanied by some assuring performances from Ewan Mc Gregor and Mélanie Laurent. Beginners is a powerfully understated piece of independent filmmaking that maintains its emotional resonance from start to finish.",True
"Very underrated character piece, although not without its flaws Rounders is about a straightflying legal student (Matt Damon) who leaves behind his gambling habits to satisfy his moralistic girlfriend. However when his best friend Worm (Edward Norton) is released from jail, the two embark on a cardsjourney that leads them from success to misfortune after Worm is caught cheating and the man who caught him (John Malkovich) wants his money back.Whereas Ben Affleck continues to go downhill after Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon has striven uphill, taking on daring productions such as The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Bourne Identity series, and of course Rounders, which features one of his best performances. Damon has become typecast as some sort of bad actor in the league of Affleck, but hes much better than his pal, and films like this prove it.Norton is once again superb as one of his characters you love to hate. Hes got the character of Worm down pat, and it really elevates the acting (along with Damon) to a level of greatness.The film is directed and written very well, offering realistic dialog and gritty environments. However the flaws of the movie are its long running time (two hours exactly), which could have been shortened, and probably the fact that its card playing is sometimes a bit alienating to the audience.That said, this is still a very underrated movie featuring outstanding performances and a unique spin on gambling flicks. Worth watching at least once in a lifetime.",False
"Pleasant Summertime Romance  Dont Overthink It!OK, OK, the professional reviews are tepid, but for my taste, A Little Chaos is a perfect summertime movie. No heavy themes, impeccable acting (Kate Winslet, Matthias Schoenaerts, Stanley Tucci, and Alan Rickman), beautiful scenery, and gorgeous late 17th c. costumes. Its one of those movies where you can sink into the cushioned theater seats, breathe the welcome airconditioning, and let the film wash over you. No heavy mental or emotional lifting required. The premise is that on a ridiculously short timetable and budget, Frances Louis XIV, the Sun King, has decreed that paradisaical gardens be created to expand the grounds at his Versailles palace. Garden design has been placed in the reliable hands of André Le Nôtre (Schoenaerts), a proponent of order in the landscape. His plans include an elaborate display of fountains. But he needs help. After interviewing numerous candidates, he chooses the wildly fictional Madame Sabine de Barra (Winslet) to create the gardens ballroom, for the reason that she will introduce new ideas (a shaky premise, there)—and, as the title suggests, a little chaos. The two of them are attracted to each other, but have vastly different temperaments and face a fairly predictable set of obstacles. Critics who poohpooh the film as a failed feminist fable miss its many pleasures: the absurd courtiers, Stanley Tucci as the kings gay brother, the interplay among the women when theyre alone behind closed doors, scenery to drool over, the joy of bringing dirt and greenery to beautiful life, and, especially, Alan Rickman playing Louis XIV—a character worthy of his imperious, reptilian charisma, as Stephen Holden said in the New York Times. Rickman directed and helped write the film, too. Acting should be about risky projects as much as it can be about entertaining, he told Joe Neumaier at the New York Daily News. The risk is what makes you want to do it. Bringing to life characters from another culture and longpast century in a revisionist history confection is almost as risky as thinking you can make water dance. The real Salle de Bal (the Bosquet des Rocailles) at Versailles was inaugurated in 1685 and is the gardens only surviving cascade. If you dont go with inflated expectations you wont be disappointed. You will be well pleased.",False

"Three of the best actors from their generation shine.The Score seems to start off slow for some, but the films speed is important for the movie. It shows how De Niros character lives his life and his life is essential to the plot. One more is what he has been saying for years, but this time he means it and will do whatever it takes to make sure nothing goes wrong. Edward Nortons character gives Bob the most grief because he isnt sure if Norton will fly straight.

"ARRIVAL: The Best Scifi Film Since CONTACTARRIVAL delivers on so many levels its impossible to describe without spoilers. The book is out there, so if you really must know before you see a film, read, The Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang...but I highly recommend you see the movie first. Honestly. You want it to unfold as a warm, fresh croissant on a chilly morning, and melt in your mouth.From visually stimulating scenes to an unexpected score masterfully composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson you recognize at once this is a thinking film youll long remember. One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away. Sure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a photojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike character of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that was impossible; you cant cue Mother Nature when its time to roll. I wanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed it was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about impending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for the right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and it rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is worth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography.The special effects team delivered, too. Amy Adams performance was stunning. Scifi is largely disregarded when awards are passed out, but if the Academy neglects to acknowledge Adams work in this film, I may boycott them forever. Adams is Oscarworthy for a Best Actress nomination for her character of linguist Dr. Louise Banks in this one, though Meryl Streep will most likely take it for Florence Foster Jenkins. It is clear the five years taken to bring this story to the screen were well worth the work. Ten welldeserved stars for ARRIVAL. I wish it a huge success at the box office so this team will continue to make more films of this caliber.",True

It was thrilling, funny, stylish, fastpaced and brilliantly acted.Downey Jr. is a delight to look at. He eats up the screen. He gives the character all sorts of mannerisms and nuances which really bring Holmes to life like never before. The chemistry and interplay between him and Jude Law is hilarious.I wasnt a big fan of Rachel Mc Adamss performance, but it didnt detract from the experience. I felt she just didnt bring as much to the table as the others. (Kinda like Katie Holmes in Batman Begins.)Guy Ritchie really outdoes himself here.

"Dark tale of a mother and son doesnt really connect with its audience Story of Barbara Daly Baekeland, who married the heir to the Bakelite fortune. We watch as the relationship with her husband slides, the relationship with her son (who narrates) goes weird and everything collides in tragedy.This is a dark little movie. Almost from the first frames the whole world seems wrong and off. The interaction between Barbara and her husband now that they have a son is at best awkward, at worst strained. Its clear from the start that Mom is paying way too much attention to her baby. Its unnerving. Whats also clear up front is that no one is normal. Everyone is clearly in their own little damaged world (Dad travels, mom is isolated and the kid just tries to cope with all of the weirdness). As a means to an effect, namely making the audience feeling uneasy, it works in spades. As a means of making a film that is something that we can either relate to or want to watch for any reason other than it intrigues our baser instincts its not really the way to go. Forgive me, but I dont know why I was watching this, I mean let me put it simply, these people are nuts. These are rich people who are just strange.Its doesnt help that the performances seem very mannered. All of the actors are very good but I felt as though I was watching a very very British mannered drama.The characters seem to be more a collection of ticks and manners then anything else. Yes I understand that everyone is wrapped up in themselves; behavior thats so guarded that each act (especially sex)seems to be for some ulterior reason, and that any unmannered act is one of self revelation, but at the same time it kept me distant. I never cared about anyone or anything, I only wanted to see how twisted this all got(And it gets pretty funky).Is it any good? Yea, he says begrudgingly. The performances are good, especially Juliane Moore, the film is extremely well crafted and as much as I bitch, it does hold your attention in the same way that a bloody car wreck does (you keep watching to see how bad it gets because you know it has nothing to do with you). I wish it was just slightly better than it is, I wish there was some sign of what life was before the baby came along, I mean why did her husband marry her, I have no clue, nor do I know why he bothered to stay married to her as long as he did. I also wish this was about real people, instead of martians, I mean most of the characters outside of the central ones seem reasonably normal, I cared more about them then the ones the film was about.Is it worth seeing? I dont know if I would go out of my way to see it. Frankly the chance to see this kind of fell into my lap so I took it, especially since a friend had asked about the film at the instant the chance to see the film arrived. Would I have wanted to pay for it? In the end no, I want to get some thing else from the film then just feeling dirty.",False
"Will take some time to process Theres a reasonable argument to say that SILENCE is one of Martin Scorseses better movies. The talk is that it was a passion project of his for decades, finally being released in all its artistic endeavors and mysteries. I suppose someone else could argue the opposite: that this is a story full of brutality and despair without the signature style of the aged director. I think Im falling right on the middle on this one. This is surely one of the years most powerful stories, and yet I have to admit it left me cold.The story follows two priests from Portugal (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) who venture into hostile Japanese country in search of their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who has abandoned his Christian faith. Some chalk it up to mere rumors. These two young ministers take the journey to find out for themselves.What begins as a fairly traditional story ventures into the heart of Japan in the 16th Century with a sharp attention to both detail and horror. This is less a story of a search for one man as it is an odyssey into the despair found in conflicting religious beliefs. Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) holds hope that Ferreira is alive while also working to convert as many locals under cover of darkness. Upon landing on the shores of Japan (smuggled in on small fishing boats from China), he encounters villages of faithful Christians who worship in secret. For them, the arrival of Rodrigues and Father Garupe (Driver) is confirmation of their beliefs. Through language barriers, it seems that God is always present.As we delve further into the country towards Nagasaki (where Ferreira is said to be held), the two priest break off on separate journeys. Rodrigues, though oftentimes alone, is shadowed by a Japanese recluse named Kichijiro, a drunk who once betrayed his faith in order to spare his life (he witnessed the execution of his entire family) but returns to the faith time again in order to make Confession and amends with the Lord. Rodrigues continues to absolve him, and yet this is the slow unraveling of an aspect of this story: do the Japanese really comprehend the religion in the same way Westerners do?There are three people who make this movie better than average: Andrew Garfield surely gives one of the years best performances as a man trapped in his own personal Hell, forced to grapple between martyrdom and eternal damnation. Its a strong year for Garfield, getting accolades and Oscar buzz for his other leading role in Hacksaw Ridge. Trust me, this is the better performance. Second is the skill of Martin Scorsese, who slowly paints a portrait of a time long forgot with such attention to tone. Its a horrifying and at times morbid story to sit through, but there was never a moment I found myself any less than fullyfocused and contemplative.Third is a surprise, a breakthrough performance by a Japanese actor named Issey Ogata who gives without a doubt one of the years most memorable performances. Throughout the film the Christians living in Japan are routinely inspected by samurai officials who intend to hunt down and capture any found citizens in violation of the law. One such official is Inoue Masashige (Ogata) who treats the job with a certain flair. Constantly waving a fan and with an ear to ear smile, this is a performance that steps above the rest of the cast by perfectly encapsulating the braggadocious nature of Japanese law without missing a beat. Its a winking devil performance that I hope the Oscars wont look over.Silence is at times hard to palpate and yet rewards the audience for its patience. Whether or not this film can be interpreted as being pro or anti Catholic is maybe not the ultimate message of this film. While the final act delves into a horrifyinglydark arena, consider the final shot before the credits begin to role (I wont spoil it). In such a brutal era with antiquated customs, isnt there still hope left to be found?",True

"Perfection Although I loved Clint Eastwood very much as an actor, I have to admit that I appreciate him even more as a director because this man does not use the standard Hollywood tricks. He just knows to tell a good story, using only good a script and great acting. Changeling is the story womans battle with the police and the system, and an indeed fascinating tribute to commitment of a person to break the corruption, coverup and the excavation to find her child that she got taken from her. The film has few explicit scenes and an atmosphere that is really tough to follow. There is really a lot going on in this emotionally difficult and fantastically filmed movie, definitely worth your time and attention. A masterpiece.",False
"Not so bad for a youthful lapse When I rented this film, I was not aware that it was hard to get. I thought it hadnt released in the cinema in Belgium because it was too dark and had simple ended up in a dim corner of the rental place. I didnt have too high expectations. Afterwards I checked for user comments here and felt people were being a bit too harsh. It is true that impact is a little bit lost sometimes because its hard to relate with the characters. Its hard to admit for anyone that theyve asked out a friend sometimes just for accompaniment and selfgratification like the characters seem to do in this film. But Im a 100 % sure that everyone has done it at least once in their life. This film is hard to watch cause it takes this very aspect of relationships and puts in under a magnifying glass. I even had to interrupt watching it, cause the brutality was making me nervous. I think the film is good in the way that it had its desired effect. Its not your cup of tea if you want to watch something entertaining, something fun with your friends. Acting is very interesting. Because it mainly plays in the same room and the film is in black and white attention is focused on the words, and even more on the gestures and facial expressions of the characters. Its worth watching if you want to watch something thats not main stream. I hope Ive helped constructing the right expectations for this film.",False
"Shocking Red December The Italian title of this Nicolas Roegs classic is A Venetian Shocking Red December yep. I had seen this film dubbed into Italian, years ago. I was taken by the look and the atmosphere I remember being unnerved but I was appalled by the acting, specially Julie Christies  one of my favorites of all time. Yesterday I saw the film again in its original English version. My goodness, what a difference! The film is even more frightening that I remembered. The atmosphere is asphyxiating. You can actually smell the rotting stench of the most beautiful city in the world. The ending leaves you breathless and the acting, well, listening to the actors real voices is another experience altogether. The pain and sudden burst of hope in Julie Christie is moving, very moving and very unsettling. Sutherland, as usual, is magnificent. The film, other than a solid cult status, remains virtually unknown by the public at large. Dont Look Now is a buried treasure that is bound to be re discovered and to all my countrymen, a piece of advise: avoid dubbed movies at all cost.",False
"Still my favorite film Every once in a while I will watch this film again and see if maybe I have grown tired of it.  Surely after Saving Private Ryan, Titanic, Crimes and Misdemeanors, or Schindlers List I have seen a better film.  Well, after every viewing there is something about Oliver Stones masterpiece that keeps me saying that I have never seen anything better.I am a sucker for Vietnam pictures.  Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter also rank in my top ten of all time.  Stories about Vietnam can run the entire gambit of human emotions.  Platoon is not only a documentation of Americas sordid involvement in a foreign civil war, it is also a dramatic story of human response.  A life developing in the most horrible of places.There have been films put together better.  There have been films with more detailed and interesting plots.  But none have ever told a more touching story of human development set in the backdrop of bloody violence and inhuman suffering.Rating: 10 out of 10.",True
"Broadway World Review: SAND CASTLES Casts Light on the Child Lost but Found and the Journey that Follows A child appears, mute and traumatized, rushing through the woods, a fugitive from ten years of captivity at the hands of a pedophile.Flashbacks to a good family time at the beach, building a sand castle crowned by a chess queen.A momentary glance away that will yield a decades worth of pain.The loss of the child (at whose despicable hands?) has wreaked its havoc on those left behind ~ the despondent alcoholic mother, Marie (Saxon Trainor); older brother Noah (Jordon Hodges), a lumber mill worker; Uncle Tommy (Randy Spence), seething with anger and an irresistible itch for revenge. Each bears their cross; all wrestle with their demons.An excerpt from Proverbs 23:18 has affirmed that Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.Sand Castles, written and produced by Mr. Hodges and directed by Clenét Verdi Rose, gives promise to the proverb as it painstakingly and dramatically tracks the Daly Familys journey to hope and Laurens to recovery.Theres a solemnity and tautness to the films pacing, an air of danger that presides in the background music by Todd Maki and in the moods of its male characters, and a promise of possibility and justice (what you might think of as great expectations).It is, however, the stunning performance of Anne Winters that makes this such a haunting and powerful film. Hers is a remarkably expressive countenance; her expressions, worth a thousand words; her eyes, a roadmap to Laurens fears and reflections. In a uniquely understated performance, Ms. Winters delivers a singularly powerful and heartwrenching performance.In the real world, the road to recovery is not a straight line. It is filled with pitfalls and detours. Sand Castles does not spare us reminders of this reality (for example, Laurens removal by Childrens Protective Services from the Daly home to foster care) and the falls from propriety of even the noblest characters (Laurens social workers illadvised affair with Noah).In the real world, as Noah notes, everyone has choices ~ some to be celebrated and some from which there is no return.In the wake of headlines that have screamed the tragedies of lost children and their enslavement by madmen ~ the worst nightmare of any parent ~ Sand Castles is an especially relevant and timely contribution. At the center of this tale of tragedy and hope, of desperation and redemption, is a message about the mindfulness that is essential to the caring of our children, the patience that is required when we must relieve them of their pain, and the hollowness of revenge. At the end of this tale is an abiding sense of reverence.Herbert Paine, Broadway World.com",False
"Good movie, definitely different, definitely not what I expected I just saw the gala premier at TIFF and overall, I enjoyed the film. The acting was terrific, with Jude Law playing Dom Hemingway in the lead. The first few minutes of the movie had me wondering what I had gotten myself into, as it really starts off with a bang (or a blow, perhaps). That feeling of not quite knowing what I was watching stayed with me for a bit, as the movie is vulgar, violent, funny, and awkward, sometimes all at once. In the end, I liked I really liked it and found myself rooting for Dom despite having a bunch of reasons not to. Its worth watching for the terrific acting, and the moments between Dom and Dickie when things get tense are great.",False
"In Greeneland, God writes the punchlines This film tells the story of a wartime love affair between Maurice, a successful, cynical and rather callous novelist, and Sarah, the beautiful but neglected wife of a dull senior civil servant. She tends to believe in the supernatural, he does not, but both are spurred on by the danger of both discovery and the bombs raining down on London. Perversely, when her husband confides to Maurice his suspicion that Sarah is having an affair, Maurice hires a private detective to investigate, in effect, himself. In the end, it is God who decrees the finale, not the characters, who accommodate as best they can to their destinies.Do we really care? This is not easy to answer. Maurice, the narrator, is a prize prick, unfeeling of others, concentrated on his misery and his work, yet obsessively jealous. Sarah provides a focus for his substantial sex drive but he does develop an affection for her. Sarah, on the other hand, clearly likes a good bonk as well, but she needs the relationship to full the void left by her husbands emotional absence, and Maurice is too selfcentred to be a real soulmate. She is also quite a nice person in comparison with nasty bitter old Maurice. So yes, we are sorry for her. We have to admire Maurice for being honest enough to tell the story but there is an air of selfflagellation about it. As a film, this is a terrific piece of work, directed by the Irish director Neil Jordan who was responsible for The Crying Game. Greene is a very cinematic novelist  at last count there were at least 40 screen versions of his works  and Jordan has very cleverly used a present  flashback  present and then forward technique to tell the story from both Maurices and Sarahs viewpoint. The gloom and danger of wartime London is effectively invoked but there was a bit of overkill in having it rain almost continuously from 1939 to 1945 (London has less rain days than Sydney!) It struck me early on that Ralph Fiennes was by no means inevitable in the part  I was reminded of the early Sam Neill. His character is really rather empty  a man whose only real commitments are to his work and sex. Julianne Moore, delightfully bad as Mrs Cheveley in An Ideal Husband, and delightfully slapstick as the childish Cora in Cookies Fortune, is much more sympathetic here. Stephen Rea (a Jordan favourite) as the cuckold is the most sympathetic of the lot or at least the most selfaware. He gives us a wonderful portrayal of stitched up dismay and yet it does not seem beyond the bounds of credibility that, knowing of the affair, he should invite Maurice to come and live with them towards the end.Greeneland is a pretty bleak place, but a couple of apparent miracles brighten things up. Greene clearly thought God had a sense of humour. The novel is said to be semiautobiographical, but the real affair Greene had with the wife of a wealthy businessman, while no doubt equally painful, did not end so melodramatically as the novel. Looking at a biography of Greene by Michael Shelden I note that Catherine Walston, whose relationship with Greene was the chief inspiration for The End of the Affair, died in 1978, aged 62, 13 years before Greene. According to Shelden, Catherine refused to see Greene on her deathbed because she didnt want him to see how sick she was. The affair itself petered out in the early fifties, though they remained in touch. Henry Walston, it seemed, asserted himself and demanded that Catherine cut down on her contact with Greene. Greene went overseas to find danger and forget, to Vietnam and elsewhere, and these trips produced at least one more major novel, The Quiet American. However Greenes career as a writer peaked with The End of the Affair. His later work is interesting and readable, but never again did he reach the same emotional depths and heights.Greene is often said to be a Catholic novelist but on the basis of this work at least he wasnt a great pitchman for the Almighty. Greene was, however, an eloquent portrayer of spiritual suffering and this aspect has been effectively brought to the screen by Neil Jordan. Perhaps it takes an Irishman to understand an English Catholic.",True
"Woody has done it again The critics have missed on this one. Dont believe the negative reviews. Its the funniest one from Woody since maybe Deconstructing Harry. Everything works. From the very original script, combining Allens bleak view of life with effervescent farcical plot line, to uniformly fine performances from Larry David, Evan Rachel Wood, Patricia Clarkson, and the rest of the cast. Comedic sparks fly nonstop. Not just light chuckles here and there at Woodys witticisms, but loud allout laughter. The scenes with Ed Begleys and Patricia Clarksons transformations of classic textbook rightwing material are especially hilarious. And in the end I came out from the theater, thinking that in a paradoxical way it was one of the most lifeaffirming pictures from the master.",True
"Sarandon is excellent....and the pairing of Ralph Fiennes as Bernard Lafferty, her trusted butler and confidante is quite interesting. I have read the biography Too Rich, the story of Doris Duke, and this film seems by far, more accurate and even amusing (as life often is). If we for example, compare this to the mediocre Lauren Bacall version, which does not portray Lafferty as human, rather as a murderous bottomfeeder. Too extreme, and probably unrealistic.Yes, Ms. Duke did apparently have a very unusual life, but we see her here, as Sarandon plays here, she also enjoyed and cherished life. We see her working fervently on her orchids, all the foundations she was passionate about, and her general intelligence. She was clearly a brilliant businesswoman, as Lafferty interjects.This film portrays real people, yes, she had an issue with drinking, as did Lafferty. However there was a tenderness and relationship which seemed to have developed between the two. Overall an interesting commentary with excellent performances and lush cinematography, attention to set decoration. 9/10.",False
"Cinema fantastic A truly beautiful and hypnotic film.Ive seen the last few Nicholas Winding Refn films, and while I liked both Bronson and Valhalla Rising a lot, they were both difficult films, in that both structure, pacing and tone were bound to alienate some people, and of course they were both marketed as somewhat mainstream films while being anything but.Part of the irony of Refns situation is that he makes films about Primal man and these protagonists invariably commit acts of great violence on those around them. This violence puts his films into the genre categories that Hollywood recognises and promotes to the public, resulting in trailers for Refn movies that grossly misrepresent the sophistication of the actual film. In that way, Valhallas intense, slowburning and almost dialoguefree mythic exploration of our savage past can be repackaged as a Vlad the Viking goes to the New World action movie.Yet both Valhalla and Bronson were highly directed films, revealing a very strong hand in control of the material. And so, I was extremely curious to see what Refn would do with the material, and whether he would be able to rein in his sometimes obtrusive style in order to allow the story more room to breathe... I shouldnt have worried. I think the director has managed to balance a genuine artistry with the demands of the genre in a way that is rarely, if ever, achieved. I absolutely loved it. Just stay the hell away from the trailer, as it reveals far too much, and again, misrepresents the films true feel.Driver has a tone of wry amusement at everything around it, much like Goslings halfsmirk, pivoted on the toothpick perpetually in the corner of his mouth. Schmucky gangsters and mob clichés provide some laughs, but the heart of the film is Goslings portrayal of the unnamed? main character and his sweet, underplayed romance with Mulligan and her young son. While an ethereal synthesizerpop soundtrack provides an attimes tender,attimes mythic undercurrent, the car chases and action scenes, when they come, are tense, brutal and brief far more Eastern Promises than The Transporter. Mulligan plays her character all trembly, weteyed, sweet and innocent and is swept away by Goslings quiet strength and selfassured charm, while Gosling speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature. The seasoned supporting cast are all very fun, except maybe for Kendricks who is relegated to a fairly irrelevant part. Of course, this is really Goslings film, and he inhabits the character completely, turning what could be a straightforward Hollyood toughguy role into a complex and contradictory character, selfconfident and physical, yet clearly lonely and possessed with a certain peculiarity and stillness, almost reminiscent of De Niros Travis Bickle.Visually the film is lush and gorgeous. Like Michael Mann, Refn and his cinematographer are able to instill LA with a sense of life and character that most directors just fail to do. Unlike Mann however, Refn opts for warm orange tones over Manns hard blues, and in one particularly beautiful sequence the familiar LA cliché of driving down the dry LA river is taken to an unexpectedly joyful conclusion. Despite its absolute craftsmanship, Driver is probably not for everybody, which makes me sad. People who prefer baldheaded muscle men slugging and wisecracking their way into their wallets should of course stay away, as this bears very little resemblance to the standard Hollywood fare associated with the genre, and they might well be disappointed.But for me, Driver was sweet, surreal, mythic, tense, fun, hilarious, revolting, and surprising. See it because it will make you a better person.And so, 10 out of 10, because it deserves it.",True

"strange, but short I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival, and cant quite decide about it. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them. Maybe that was the point, that we are all in a bubble of our own, but these people didnt compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates. At a running time of just over an hour, the characters werent very well developed. Lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and the slightlycreepylooking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes, that most of the characters made for a living, were somehow more interesting than the live people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never quite came together.",True
"I was left speechless by this movie This film left me speechless, and I still have a hard time putting how I feel about this movie into words. After seeing it the first time in the theater, my friend and I couldnt bring ourselves to say a word to each other...not even in the car on the ride back. The second time I saw it, after purchasing it, another friend and I walked around the campus for half an hour in silence. The third time, a friend and I sat in silence in her room for an hour after the movie was over. This film is that profound, touching, and moving.Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...Spring is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Visually it is fantastic, though several films surpass it in this aspect. However, the film manages to speak directly to the soul (or...failing to believe in the soul...something deep inside anyone watching it), and this is where its beauty lies. Parts are so affecting that a painful nostalgia for a place you never knew overwhelms you.I am sorry I cannot be more helpful...the quality that makes this movie so wonderful is well beyond words for me.",False

"Those Who Ignore HistoryAre Doomed to Repeat It!..........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA....and ORLANDO, FL ******** POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS ********* There are, undoubtedly, scenes in Lee Daniels The Butler that made me feel quite uncomfortable. Most certainly, many other viewers will echo similar discomfort experienced while watching this near great movie. Unfortunately, the existence of atrocities and flagrant injustices in our not too distant past doesnt mean that they should be whitewashed or airbrushed out of our collective memories! (Absolutely no pun intended here) Dont let me give you the wrong impression about The BUTLER. In just over 2 hours until end credits, there are but a scant few minutes of images that some of us would, perhaps, just as soon forget. At the heart of this remarkable film, is a tale of a great generational divide between estranged father and firstborn son; redemption, change, forgiveness, repentance and catharsis are also pivotal elements in this Inspired by a True Story drama painted on a historical backdrop canvass.Although The BUTLER does highlight the tremendous progress our society has made in the past century toward fulfillment of Dr. Martin Luther Kings Dream, obviously, there is an undercurrent underscoring the fact that this area is one that involves constant selfreinvention to ensure continued improvement.There are multiple noteworthy elements here. First, Oprah Winfreys triumphant return to an onscreen leading role. Despite having done numerous voiceovers in recent years, BUTLER represents the end of a 15 year hiatus, when she participated in the illfated BELOVED. Her performance, although not quite Oscar nomination caliber, would win, without a doubt, an Academy Award for best Billionaire Female Actor on the Planet, if such a prize existed! Accepting this role surely resulted in reduced income for Oprah in 2013. If that doesnt make her participation in this project a Labor of Love, what would? BUTLER is my pick for 2013 Best Ensemble Performance Golden Globe. Cast Credits give the impression of a page lifted directly from a Whos Who in Acting & Entertainment! Cuba Gooding, Jr.; Robin Williams, in a refreshing, but brief, appearance as a pensive and softspoken President Eisenhower; Vanessa Redgrave; Clarence Williams III; James Marsden as President Kennedy; John Cusack, as an ever brooding and duplicitous President Nixon; David Oyelowo, as the rebellious prodigal son; Terence Howard; Lenny Kravitz; Mariah Carey; Jane Fonda, who sparkled as Nancy Reagan and Alan Rickman as her carefulnottosteponhertoes husband, Ronald! The only weak link, in my opinion, was Liev Schreiber as President Lyndon B. Johnson. His portrayal just did not resonate with me.Quite frankly, despite analyzing carefully for any historical missteps, there were only a couple rather minor ones that were noticeable. About threequarters into BUTLER, the storyline, focus and viewer interest level seemed to sputter a bit, but got right back on track rather quickly.The film did attempt to provide moments of comic relief from the oftentimes somber onscreen events, most of them evoking healthy laughter but a handful of them kind of fell flat. If it werent for these few mentioned flaws, BUTLER most definitely would have been rewarded with a 10*Star* rating! When released on DVD, rest assured it will be added to my 800+ collection! .ENJOY/DISFUTELA!! Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!",False
"This is GREAT Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, Scarface is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the king in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has around 180+ Fwords and is almost three hours long.

This is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this. You will not be disappointed. 9/10",True
"Westerns dont get any better than this.This is the third,and arguably the best, of the socalled spaghetti western trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of Americanmade westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series Rawhide when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the incomparable John Wayne. I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didnt like about it. Most of the IM Db reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirtpoor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know its coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen. Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joes subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated. In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film Dr. Zhivago were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesnt release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When its over, you feel that youve been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you havent seen this film, buy it right away. Dont rent it because you will not want to part with it once youve seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.",False
"Beautiful, terrible, perfect adolescence Dont come looking for plot  our teen years didnt have one either. Like Dazed and Confused before it, Palo Alto throws us into the joys, pains, and emotions of the life of Americansuburban adolescence. Though unlike its defacto predecessor, Palo Alto takes a look at this world through a softer, more elegant, more personal lens. The film bounces us around from character to character, all high school students in the titled town. Reckless parties, desperate sexual encounters, jealousies, weed, breaking things, sexually aggressive teachers (James Franco) and, of course, homework. Its all part of the world of Palo Alto. There is no rhyme or reason. Or is there? James Franco (whose book of short stories the film is based on) plays Mr. B, the high school soccer coach, tells his favorite player April that everything has a reason. Maybe hes right. You be the judge. Director Gia Coppola, in her first featurelength effort, works wonders at keeping the characters and the world of Palo Alto authentic. Glee exists in a land far, far away from here. Instead, we get an unfiltered look at what it takes to navigate the turbulence of adolescence and find our path to adulthood. Its a painful but beautiful thing.",False
"Sweet Summer Sleeper If you like smart dialogue, an imaginative narrative, and well developed character, SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is your film. The premise is well articulated with believable relationships portrayed by a talented cast. Audrey Plazas star turn took the dopey outsider and added her own understated charm that illuminated every frame, especially the campfire scene with Mark Duplass. His performance was perhaps the riskiest.....playing a lonely but driven crusader whose character took a little from FISHER KING, a little from HEROS, a little more from BEAUTIFUL MIND and added a touch of STARMAN.The ending might have seemed contrived without the sincerity of director Colin Trevorrow. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED was certainly the best film Ive seen so far this summer especially after my disappointment with Wes Andersons most recent effort. It was its last night in Tallahasee attended by perhaps only a dozen people.....surprisingly many stag guys who werent afraid to laugh out loud. I wonder how many of them were time travelers.",False
"SWTE is an INSULT to ones intelligence!SWTE is a very, very simplistic psychological thriller full of questionable situations  which really insults ones intelligence!Martin is supposed to be a shorttempered and obsessive husband but these qualities are not properly presented at all in the beginning, leading up to the boat tragedy in the sea. And the manner in which Martin discovers his supposedly dead wife is totally artificial and laughable.Btw, I think Robert Bergin  with his very, very decent looks  is NOT the right actor for this negative role. He hardly impressed me. It is as if he was deliberately trying to be frightening. I sincerely want someone to remake this movie and create a serious, wellplotted and wellpresented psychological thriller out of it – devoid of insults to ones intelligence.This is a totally stupid film made by – hold your breath! – a very experienced director whod done some memorable films. And it is shocking that this joke of a film was a big hit! Shocking indeed!On the plus side, I really enjoyed the background music of the film and loved the beach house Martin and Laura were living in.",False
"Man on the Moon is a strong film with an excellent performance by Jim Carrey Man on the Moon is one of the most heartfelt endeavors Ive ever seen on film.  With each frame, you can feel how much the project means personally to all involved, especially to star Jim Carrey and producer Bob Zmuda. Although personal adoration for the subject of ones movie does not always translate into a film that audience members will identify with, Man on the Moon succeeds brilliantly.  Between Milos Formans unique directing style, the actors performances, and Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewskis writing, the film is able to simultaneously make you a member in one of Andy Kaufmans audiences, experiencing both joy and frustration at his antics, and a close friend who sees, or thinks they see, the Andy Kaufman behind the masks. Just as Karaszewski and Alexander did with the Ed Wood or Larry Flint biopicks, they challenge our concept of what it means to be successful by giving dignity to to the seeming misfits of our society.  However, a biopick like Man on the Moon succeeds or fails mainly on the grounds of the lead performance.  Jim Carrey proved his dramatic talent last year with a performance in The Truman Show that should have translated into an Oscar, and this year he again gives what will likely be the best performance of the year.  Carrey approaches the role of Kaufman with a level of professionalism and enthusiasm far greater than that displayed by many of todays acclaimed actors.  Carrey adopts Kaufmans mannerisms flawlessly and becomes Kaufman so convincingly that you forget Carrey is acting.  The films other stars, in particular Paul Giamatti, Courtney Love, and Danny De Vito, all turn in excellent performances as well.Man on the Moon is both inspiring and thought provoking  a must see.",False
"The Simple Bear Necessities The Jungle Book, one of Disneys ultimate classics, it has great characters, an awesome story and terrific animation. Ill admit it, I adore Disney movies, I could never choose just one Disney movie as my favorite, I love them all for so many different reasons. The Jungle Book is one of my favs though, after buying the new release on DVD, I realized that I love this movie now more than ever. The reason that I think this movie is so wonderful is because of the characters, they just brought so much life to the story and really made this into a wonderful Disney classic.Mowgli is found in a basket as a baby in the deep jungles. Bagheera, the panther who discovers the boy, promptly takes him to a wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted to jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, visiting the wolves and getting his face licked eagerly when he arrives. That night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a maneating tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the man village, to protect him and those around him. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle and loses Bagheera. Kaa, the hungry python, hypnotizes Mowgli into a deep and peaceful sleep, traps him tightly in his coils, and tries to devour him, but comically fails. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol. Bagheera finds Mowgli and they argue; Mowgli runs away from Bagheera. The boy soon meets up with the funloving bear Baloo, who shows Mowgli the fun of having a carefree life and promises not to take him to the man village. Mowgli now wants to stay in the jungle more than ever. Shere Khan is after Mawgli though and wont rest till he kills him. Seriously, these are some of the most memorable characters in Disney history, we have Baloo, the care free party bear that just wants to have fun and only needs the bear necessities of life. Begheera, a panther, that weve all known this kind of person, the one that just wants to get down to business and get as much done as quickly as possible, the party pooper, but deep down still has that heart. And one of Disneys most memorable villains of all time, Shere Khan, voiced by George Sanders, classy, sassy, menacing and vicious, I wouldnt be surprised if he was Scars inspiration(the lion villain in The Lion King). If you havent seen The Jungle Book, just buy it, believe me, its worth the money. Its a classic fun animated film that I will love forever, still to this day I will always sing along to Bear Necessities, its a good time.10/10",False
"The definition of satire on film I first saw Heathers when it was first released in 1989 and to this day I remember most of the lines and scenes which cause me to laugh at all the wrong times.I went to see the film because the hot actor of the time was Winona Ryder and I was in love with her after seeing her in Lucas and Beetlejuice and 1969. In each movie she played a version of a Goth chick  very smart, very pretty, but with a monotone delivery and moody attitude.I also wanted to catch Christian Slater. I remembered him from his role as Binx in The Legend of Billie Jean and in the film Tucker: The Man and His Dream Heathers is great satire of teen life back in the 1980s. It picks apart every teen angst and cliche and spins it in a goofy plot of rebellion and revenge gone amuck.Ryder, playing Veronica, is on the fringe of the popular clic run by 3 girls names Heather. Each Heather is abusive, dumb, and pretty. For any teen who wanted to fit in the popular crowd but couldnt make it completely will identify with Veronica.She meets a new student, J.D., played by Slater who is the complete opposite of the popular crowd. He wants nothing to do with them or the school. Veronica finds this interesting and soon she falls under the expert manipulation of J.D. Due to what starts as an accidental death, the two start a chain of events that looks like a teen suicide epidemic that was the common fear of adults back then.Slater steals the movie from Ryder with his sly Jack Nicholson line delivery and James Dean attitude. Ryder is good but she cant stop Slater from chewing up the scenes.The adults in the movie are classic clueless parental units that teen movies seem to always need. The best one is the guidance counselor that says Whether or not a teenager decides to kill themselves is the biggest decision of their life. Watching this movie I kept saying to myself They just did not do that? or They just did not say that? I never laughed so hard in my life at that time.A special treat was the Heather played by Shannen Doherty. Besides Ryder and Slater, she was the only other actor that I knew (except for Patrick Labyorteaux, who played the jock Ram who can now be seen on JAG as Ens. Roberts). Before Heathers, Shannen had played good girl roles and had just ended a series called Our House where she wanted to become a pilot. Her role became more interesting after finding out she turned out like her Heather character in real life.The only thing that bothers me about this film today is that it could never be made today. The suicide epidemics (that still happen from time to time) has been replaced by killing ones classmates at school. I just dont think the studios would have the guts to film a satire like Heathers today.As a side note: I read some of the previous comments from users who have only seen this movie on TV. All I can say is see the uncut version either on a movie channel or rent the DVD. The language and satire will only work in its uncensored format.",False
"a very well done film that continues to amaze me...When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too unordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After youve seen it, you know youve seen something.A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her typical teenager role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvaris character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the videotaping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His purpose in the film, unlike anyone elses, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to move its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.",True
"An expert craftsman at work A tight script? Check. Capable actors? Check. Lots of witty dialogue? Check. A jazzy soundtrack? Check. Beautiful photography in idyllic settings? Check.Yes, all the ingredients are there. Just leave it to the 79year old chef to create a delicious dish out of it. When everything is right, a Woody Allen movie is a delight to watch. And with Irrational Man, this is absolutely the case.Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone are clearly enjoying themselves as the grumpy philosophy professor and his admiring student and lover. Allens script plays in a lighthearted way with serious philosophical concepts such as guilt, evil and righteousness. Also, he throws in a murder mystery and makes the suspense last until the very end.Irrational Man will not be one of Allens greatest movies, because it lacks an extraordinary element like Cate Blanchetts performance in Blue Jasmine, or the historical dimension of Midnight in Paris. But even without such an extra ingredient, Irrational Man shows an expert craftsman at work. In a couple of years time, it might just turn out to be one of his most underrated films.",True

"Epic story that mixes lust with a mystery story  worthy stuff but a touch too slow Tuscany WW2.  Traumatised by the loss of anyone she cared for or loved, Canadian nurse Hana stays behind her unit with a dying patient, Count Laszlo de Almásy.  de Almásy is burnt all over and has lost his memory.  When a vengeful, mysterious thief arrives at their abandoned monastery with a past that seems to include de Almásy , and as Hana reads from his book, memories return regarding his past.  He relives his story of lust and love and the destructive force that forbidden passion unleashed upon his life.This is quite a modern epic.  It has the running time of an epic, it has the gorgeous cinematography of an epic, it has the acting of an epic and it has a story of love (lust) against the backdrop of major events in history. Even though it changes or leaves out a significant amount of the original novel it still manages to be a great mix of passionate desire and mystery. The mystery of the story is represented by the thief Caravaggio who casts light on what he knows of de Almásys past (as he sees it) while the love story is unfolded as it develops in a passionate affair between him and Katherine, a colleagues wife.  The story is compelling enough to carry the long running time, at times the pace seems a little slow and when I saw it in my local multiplex there were some moments where large portions of the audience seemed to be shifting in their seats.The love of the story was interesting as it seems to be contrasted with Hanas relationship with Kip the bomb disposal expert.  While de Almásys relationship with Katherine starts as lust and desire before growing into what seems to be love (or could be grief at the result of their affair), Hanas is portrayed as purer and more careful as she fears those she loves will die.  This difference helped me see that the film did want to show the destructive power of lust and affairs, however the fact that the central relationship was based more on lust than love took away from the emotional core of the story.The acting is almost impeccable.  Fiennes is excellent even when he is lost behind an unrecognisable mask of burnt flesh.  Thomas is actually very good, I find she tends to be very wooden in some things but this type of very English character brings the best out of her.  Binoche is excellent as Hana and carries the heart of the film.  Dafoe is truly excellent  his element of the story is the mystery and he does it well.  He is a great actor and deserves to be in things this good.  The support cast include plenty of good actors including Colin Firth, Jurgen Prochnow and Naveem Andrews.The film is beautifully shot  even though its all a bit too picturesque to be real!  However the director can handle himself well with many different scenes  a tense bomb diffusal, a passionate love scene, a dangerous sand storm etc.  Overall the slow pace may frustrate some younger audiences but this is a really good film that draws its values from classy sources.",True
"Utterly refreshing. Green is back. Rudd shines.All hope was lost for David Gordon Green. After a string of cultready indie flicks, he sold out in the best possible way and made the hilarious Pineapple Express. I hoped it was a one off, or at least, that he would remain good at comedy. But the disappointing Your Highness and the I cantevenbeartolookatits IM Dbpage The Sitter dont look too promising for his future. Now with Prince Avalanche, it seems like hes taken a good look at himself and realized what he does best. Small scale dramas concerning the human condition, especially regarding romantic relationships. I always love good films about littlethought of jobs and the guys who do the line painting of the roads in the middle of nowhere is a fascinating one. Prince Avalanche is a dual character study of an introvert and an extrovert but goes beyond the odd couple clichés. Together, they cover enough ground to find relatable areas, and with dialoguedriven scenes, it cuts to the core of what they live for and how that drive changes and grows throughout the course of the film.Paul Rudd is absolutely outstanding here. Im so glad hes finally found a role to test his dramatic talent without having to ignore his brand of comedy, though much of the humour of this film is incidental and sparse. Hes incredibly subtle and commanding. Unfortunately, Emile Hirsch looks amateur next to Rudd and he rarely feels as sincere. Sometimes the little conflicts between them suffer because of it which make the film feel slower than it is, but they still drive the character development in an interesting way. Rudd aside, the highlight of the film is the great cinematography. Sometimes the cutaways and montages are more emotionally engaging than the words as they think of all the symbols possible in this environment with these characters. Its a film that conjures a mood more than anything and it reassures me that David Gordon Green never left, he was just taking a break. I regret that Ive more or less forgotten what happens in his first four films but Avalanche makes me want to revisit them soon. Its a beautiful simple film which ends on a lovely hopeful note. A true catharsis from the social order of life and utterly refreshing to watch.8/10",False
"Strong contender for best movie of 2009Quite easily the best movie of 2009 and the best war movie since Black Hawk Down and maybe even beyond that, The Hurt Locker does something that few other war movies seem to be able to do. Rather than focusing on rapidaction combat scenes and the ohsoemotional mental breakdowns that all soldiers seem to dramatically endure in Hollywood (Platoon, much?), it emphasizes the relationships of soldiers and the intensity of everyday living in Iraq– intensity that doesnt diminish when the guns are holstered. And thats where youll see the real difference.The film introduces a seemingly new and unique idea by following a U.S. Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team as they go around defusing potential bombs all around town– a concept that allows the typical fastaction war theme to take a backseat to the dramatic intensity of the three team members escapades and arguments. Its all about survival and this time around, its the calm, isolated atmosphere and the feeling of never being truly safe that creates the everpresent suspense. The exceptional editing is partially to thank for such constant energy and pace. Quick transitions ensure that there is never a dull moment and the audience is always thrust into the middle of the action. Plus, director Kathryn Bigelow employed some amazing cinematography (thanks to Barry Ackroyd, United 93) and some of the best shaky handheldcam and zoom work Ive seen yet. It seems that, for some, this might be a turnoff, but personally, I believe those who complain about shaky cam need to take a closer look at its purpose and realize that its far more effective in establishing a documentarylike feel for raw and engaging films such as this one.The interaction between the soldiers is a key point of the film and the entire project is clearly intended to be largely characterdriven. You will more than likely find yourself sympathizing with all of the main characters at some point and several others along the way. More than just observing a characters breakdown at the scene of war such as in films like Jarhead, The Hurt Locker immerses the viewer in the world of the characters themselves and practically forces you to care for them– and I mean that in the best way possible. And perhaps the difference is also partially distinguished by the quality of acting. And if theres anyone who deserves recognition for their acting, its most certainly Jeremy Renner, who surprises with a topnotch performance as Staff Sergeant William James. His performance will have you laughing at bits of humor scattered throughout, gasping in disbelief at one point, shedding a sympathetic tear at another, and yelling at him in exasperation in yet another scene. The characters are never twodimensional and the film always manages to provide constant reminders that all of the soldiers are just normal people in war situations, driving its purpose home even more effectively. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are impressive in their own roles and share great chemistry both with each other and with Renner. The relationships between the three follow no stereotyped guidelines and their interactions are almost always unpredictable. Further down the billing, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes also give solid performances worth mentioning.Overall, The Hurt Locker is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and packs a visual and cinematographic punch without the overthetop Hollywood action scenes and special effects. While the storyline may be inaccurate when it comes to certain little details (as many war vets have noted), its a unique one and allows for much more realistic and wellrounded characters. Youll walk away with your heart still beating fast for a good while after the credits roll and itll make you think for an even further extended period of time. Everything about its design and execution will stick with you.The Motion Picture Underground",False
"There are some very funny scenes in this one but it has a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch.Its not that I cant stop I just figure why should I...its not like Im cheating on her. Jon (Gordon Levitt) has a fun group of friends and is passionate about a few things. One of which is porn. Because of this obsession he is unable to have a healthy relationship with anyone. When he meets Barbara (Johansson) he thinks he found the perfect girl. Little by little he begins to wonder if he will ever feel about a woman the way he feels about his porn. First off I will have to say that this is not for everyone. If you offend easy then avoid this. Also the first five minutes are the raunchiest in terms of dialog so if you can make it past that you should be OK. As far as the movie goes I did enjoy it but the thing about this movie is the abundance of sex and porn will distract from the true meaning of the movie. The movie isnt necessarily about addiction but more about watching a man trying to connect with a human in a way he never has before. There are some very funny scenes in this one but it does have a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch. Acting is great but all of this wont be given a fair chance because of the in your face porn aspect. That is a shame. Overall, a very well done and good movie that wont be given a chance by many people because of the subject. I give it a B+.",False
"The best movie of all time.What can one say about their favorite movie?  A movie that would make one laugh, in suspense, excited, and even touched. A film that takes two personalities which clash, and learn to get along with each other, to where they actually care for one another in the end.  A film that touches ones soul, is a film that one can consider to be their favorite of all time. Robert De Niro plays Jack Walsh, a ex Chicago police officer who is currently a bounty hunter.  He works in Los Angeles for Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) who is a bail bonds man.  Eddie offers Jack a job to catch and bring back the infamous Jonathan the Duke Markukas (Charles Grodin). Jonathan is a accountant who stole millions of Jimmy Serranos (Dennis Farina) money, and gave it all to charity.  Jonathan jumped bail and is in hiding.  Jack needs to find John, bring him to the L.A. county jail within four days, and Jack will collect 100 thousand dollars.  Jack does find John, in New York City, the first day.  But Jack has many people following him.  First theres the FBI, led by Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto) who wants John to testify against Jimmy Serrano.  Second theres Tony Darvo (Richard Foronjy) and Robert Miranda (Joey), two dimwits working for Serrano, who want John dead.  Then there is Marvin Dofler (John Ashton), another bounty hunter who wants John also, but for a smaller price.     From there on, its a cross country trip which involve all of the men looking for Jack and John.  A film which has some very exciting moments with action.  Other moments where the scenes are intense where Jack and Johns lives are in danger. And scenes where the two men share each others thoughts and feelings, which surprisingly makes the movie touching. The acting by De Niro is at his best.  He does his usual tough guy attitude, but he also mixes it with some humor, and emotions.  Charles Grodin is also great as the sensitive accountant who is the exact opposite of Jacks personality. And Dennis Farina is funny and scary as the outraged mob boss who has a vicious attitude. The music by Danny Elfman, I find to be his career best. Its not like his famous BATMAN, BETTLEJUICE, or SLEEPY HOLLOW style of score.  Its more like a mixture classic Chicago rhythm and blues, which even Elfman himself considered to be his most unusual score.      The writing by George Gallo is also excellent.  He manages to fit a cross country story within two hours of time, while still bringing out personalities of the characters and making sure there are no holes in the plot.  He also manages to have some very funny scenes involving Jack and John. And the direction by Martin Brest is outstanding.  He keeps the movie at a very fast pace, without any slowing down. He does brilliant moves like having De Niro and Grodin improvising their lines while arguing.  Brest also does a great job by making the film enjoyable for its 125 minutes. This is a movie that touched me, it can be considered a mans movie on the surface.  But take apart this film, and its also a film that women can enjoy also.  The most emotional scenes involve Jack seeing his exwife and daughter after not seeing them for ten years.  It shows that everybody makes a mistake in life, and that we can all try to forgive people that emotionally hurt us.       People say that one can identify a persons personality by the movies and music that they like.  To find out what I am like, pop in this movie into your DVD player or VCR, and youll see.  Saying this movie is better than CITIZEN KANE, STAR WARS, GODFATHER, and GONE WITH THE WIND is a pretty bold statement. But, the character of Jack Walsh shows my personality. This is the way I am, therefore its my favorite movie of all time. And Im not the only one, Robert De Niro said on a interview on Oprah Winfrey, that this is his most enjoyable film that hes done.  ***** (out of five; THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME)",False
"Wha ???Dont quite understand the very high ratings for this  I picture friends of the producer, or interns at the distributor working away to find new ways to praise with faint damns. I saw it at BAM in Brooklyn, and the mostly hipster audience sat in stunned silence throughout  with occasional relieved chuckles at the few flashes of stupidity that came off as funny. Loud, violent, all closeups and menacing pretentious music unrelated to the action.Pattinson indeed breaks his pretty boy mold, and works very hard  but a lot of fucks and running very fast down urban streets does not constitute a breakout performance. JL Leigh does her usual sterling job as a frighteningly dumb victim  but she was on screen for maybe 4 minutes. The only performance that worked was the 16yo girl Crystal  Taliah Webster seemed to inherently get the power of underplaying, and she did it brilliantly. Of course, she disappears as the whole mess grinds down, ceding the screen to the boys.The coda at the end was indeed touching  but not in the way the director(s) may have intended. Actual (?) mentally disabled clients in treatment were shown in a therapy group as the credits rolled  they were sweet and fascinating, but they were being used  hard  in a commercial film, as a career move by a millionaire actor. Also, for a story trading so freely in the Queens, NY milieu  the sudden emergence of a large haunted house fun park, setting for a pointlessly violent beating of one of the few interesting characters, followed by giving him a huge dose of LSD  was ridiculous.

"One Of The All Time Great Westerns One of the best and mostliked films of the 1960s, this is still a fun movie to watch today. When I saw this on DVD on a nice flatscreen set, I was amazed how good this looked. I had seen it several times before on VHS and hadnt realized how good this was photographed. I just discovered Conrad Hall was the cinematographer, which explains it. Few, if any, were better than him.One remembers this western for several things: the two leads looking over their shoulders incredulous that their pursers seem to be always there; Paul Newman riding a bicycle to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head, the beautiful Katharine Ross, the chemistry of Newman and Robert Redford as a twoman team, on and on. Those three lead actors, with the repartee between them, and the likability of each, make them fun to watch as they dominate this picture. Its just solid entertainment and another example of good filmmaking that doesnt need a lot of Rrated material to make it successful. Photographywise, the western scenery was great, there were some wonderful closeup shots and I really liked the tinted oldtime footage inserted in here. So, when you combine all the elements, its no surprise this film won so many awards and endures so well.",False

The role suits him really good. Dont know why, but in some scenes I pictured him in some movies/series based on Marcel Prousts book. He would be perfect for one of the roles of Proust.I did not really like the ending. It was ...hmmm ... too ordinary.

"Here We Go Greetings again from the darkness. An indie gem is meant to be a term of respect for a little movie that manages to make an emotional connection, usually while being screened at a film festival or in a very limited and brief theatrical run. The best ones drive us to encourage everyone we know to take the time to see it. Such is writer/director Destin Crettons latest.Some movies offer a promising premise and then let us down with faulty execution. Short Term 12 is actually better than its premise would lead you to expect. Credit goes to Mr. Crettons quasidocumentary directorial style, tremendous acting from support characters played by John Gallagher Jr (Mason), Kaitlyn Dever (Jayden), and Keith Stanfield (Marcus), and a stunning lead performance from rising star Brie Larson (Grace).Grace and Mason help run a foster care facility. We witness first hand their daily work with the kids, some of it quite mundane ... though other moments incredibly powerful. Grace and Marcus have their own personal connections to this way of life, and also happen to be in a relationship that seems built on avoiding the communication and connection that goes into their daily jobs.The use of art as a communication device plays a role throughout. Marcus uses his rap lyrics, newcomer Jayden draws and writes childrens stories. These two kids are particularly important because they also mirror the inner sanctum of Mason and Grace, and we see these people all battle demons in hope of living a normal life. This is not a story of saints and sinners ... these are just people coming to grip with the deck theyve been dealt.You will recognize Gallagher from his work on HB Os Newsroom, and Dever made quite an impression in her time on Justified. Larsons star is on the rise thanks to her presence in The Spectacular Now and Don Jon, as well as some upcoming projects.

"A Well Acted Cold War Thriller Bridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that features a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone its usually special, that being said the film doesnt quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielbergs seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isnt as good as it could have been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.",False

"Made me think Vanilla Sky was a wonderfully thought out movie. Or rather, Abre Los Ojos was well thought out. I watched that movie late one night, excited about what was to come. I wasnt disappointed. By the end of the movie, I was awstruck. I couldnt get it off my mind. The whole idea of it just blew me away. The ending, was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through. The cast, superb. It was an all around wonderful movie. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. Ive seen it four or five times and Im always finding something new. Its a movie to keep you interested forever.",True
"Smart, funny, eventful, and well performed The Martian, based on the novel of the same name written by author Andy Weir, is an eventful movie that serves both as an epic scifi adventure, but also provides viewers with some smart laughs. Those are who not that interested in scifi will probably end up liking the movie, because it is not unrealistic. Acting wise, Matt Damon puts in an excellent performance as the lead, and supporting actors such as Jessica Chastain, also put in solid performances. Probably one of the best aspects of the film, is that the mood of the movie is quite optimistic, considering that the situation of being stuck on mars, is quite a scary one, that requires a lot of panic. In Conclusion, The martian is a fun, smart movie, that is likely to be enjoyed by most audiences who watch it.",False
"Oceans Five.John Bridgers gang of thieves are double crossed and left for dead after a daring gold raid in Venice. The surviving members regroup and convene in L.A. to enact revenge and recapture their gold.......the job is on!This could have been a complete disaster, Im British and the wave of revulsion that boomed in my homeland upon hearing of this remake was explosive; how dare they remake a British institution was the cry. Things were not helped in the run up to the films release by its main star {and drawing card} Edward Norton, proclaiming that the film was a contractual obligation and that fans of his work would be better advised to give The Italian Job a miss!Had to be a stinker then surely? Actually no it isnt. Director F. Gary Gray hasnt remade the Italian Job of 1969, in fact he hasnt even reimaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. So what we get is a very cool heistcome revenge moviethats maybe a tad too glossy at times, but its got a pretty sharp script, tight action sequences and a group of actors working very well as a team. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight.I have jokingly titled this film Oceans 5, but that is in no way detrimental to The Italian Job, it lacks the jazzy coolness of Soderberghs Oceans 11, but its a fun and enjoyable picture all in its own right, its rating of just under 7 here on IM Db is actually spot on. 7/10",False
"Animated Tarzan A Pleasant Surprise I found this surprisingly good because not only was animation well done  which they all seem to be in the past decade  but an involving, actionpacked story that was interesting starttofinish. The action is not overdone, however. The color in here is magnificent and it looks spectacular on DVD.The film turned out to be a good combination of drama, action, comedy and romance. I would think this would be a little too frightening, however, for little kids, for those wondering about that. The only negative I had was listening to the grating voice of Rose O Donnell. That, and her New York City, accent, is definitely not appealing. Otherwise, I have nothing but good things to say about this film.",False
"The Passenger is back and as mysterious as ever This is from a feature I wrote 30 years ago, when 30 myself, on The Passenger for a now defunct London film magazine (Films Illustrated) where readers could discuss/analyse/deconstruct favourite movies (before the age of video and DVD!). I am revisiting it now that The Passenger is available again after a 20 year disappearance. However as I am limited to 1,000 words I have had to edit The Passenger will remain a film of the mid 70s, as one of Antonionis previous films, Blow Up, remains a film for and symbolises the 60s. It also contains one of Jack Nicholsons definitive performances (along with Chinatown, The Last Detail and One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest) and has, perhaps, been a trifle overshadowed by these films all emerging within a short period of time of each other and the enormous publicity and wordofmouth they have generated. But The Passenger has proved itself a strangely durable film and, like Chinatown, one that will remain around for a long time, both in the consciousness of its admirers and, one hopes, constant revivals.Antonionis third Englishspeaking film, The Passenger, like Blow Up and Zabriskie Point, centres around the oblique, unresolved aspects of life. In Antonionis films  as in life  there are no easy answers, things are not tidied up, explained, sorted out.So it is with The Passenger. Jack Nicholson is Locke, an outwardly successful television journalist, but he also is being eaten away by his own disillusionment with the job and the value of his interviews, and that general malaise that affects Antonionis people. When the film begins, we find him on location in Chad where his jeep breaks down and gets bogged in the sand. Locke breaks down and collapses on the sand as the camera pans away over the strange but beautiful desert panorama.We next see Locke, in an advanced state of exhaustion, struggling back to his hotel and a cool shower, and discovering that the man in the next room, who looks rather like him, has died. We are very conscious of the stillness in the hotel  the blue walls, a fly buzzing, the noise of the fan, Locke staring intently at the dead man on the bed. We hear their dialogue of the previous evening and the aural flashback changes to a visual one by some very neat editing. Locke changes rooms, passport photos and luggage, and finds it quite easy to take on a new identity. How desperate his need is can be judged by his conversations back in Europe with the free, liberated girl (Maria Schneider) he meets up with. (I used to be somebody else, but I traded him in). She, incidentally, is freer than Locke could ever be.It transpires Locke has taken over the identity of a gunrunner, Robertson. Perhaps it is best not to go into the plot in too much detail. Best all round just to pick out some of the marvellous moments along the way to the final breathtaking conceit. Theres Locke, back in London, daringly visiting his old haunts  delighting in being someone else, but of course he isnt. Later on he is suspended in a cable car high about the ocean his arms outstretched like a bird in flight. Later still, the girl asks him what he is running from, and he tells her to turn around and we see what she sees  the road behind them.By now, we the audience are caught up in this mesmerising film and its deliberations of he mysteries of identity. We are now totally involved in Lockes plight. He has given up one identity for another and becomes more and more helpless as the situation gets out of his control. Finally, in a remote Spanish hotel he can go no further, either as himself or as his new identity, as his wife and the gunrunners close in on him. One shouldnt spoil the last sequence for those still to see it, but it shows the only real freedom from identity and self is in death. The final scene shows us the aftermath: as the sun goes down, the hotelkeeper comes out for a walk, a woman sits in the doorway resting. For some people, who do not question their existence, the continuity of life goes on.Antonioni, now in his sixties, is one of the great Italian directors who, like Fellini and Visconti, burst upon the international film scene in the late 50s. His trilogy of Italian films, L Avventura, La Notte and L Eclisse, and his first colour film The Red Desert (all with Monica Vitti) contributed to the renaissance of the European cinema. Then he switched to his Englishspeaking films, of which Blow Up was the first. He is as much a master of landscape as John Ford was in his genre. He thinks nothing of painting whole streets or trees to get the effect he wants. Blow Up is the only film from the whole, crazy period of Swinging London films that has not dated and which encapsulates what it was really all about. It remains one of the great films. Like Bergman, Bunuel or Fellini you either respond to his vision or reject it totally. His images linger on in the mind, his work never dates.That is what part of what I wrote in 1976 and The Passenger indeed remains endlessly fascinating and particularly so now that it is available again. Even at the Antonioni retrospective in 2005 it was not available to include in the season, but we did have cast members Jenny Runacre and Steve Berkoff there to speak warmly of its making and importance.Lets hope a new generation will discover its timeless appeal, and amazingly Antonioni now in his 90s is still with us, if rather frail. A 2005 short of his was shown last year on the great statue of Moses in Rome and was also in its own way fascinatingly mysterious.",False
"A disturbing, raw film with a powerhouse story and great acting Mysterious Skin is a movie that I heard very little about. Never saw the trailer, never saw a poster nothing. Until one day I was just looking up movies online and I came across this film. I looked up the website, watched the trailer, and said I want to see this. So I didnt get around to it when I lived in California since it came and went very quickly however the film did show up in a little theater about 5 miles from my house so I figured I have to check this film out and so I did.Mysterious Skin is the story of two boys Brian (Brady Corbet) and Neil (Joseph Gordon Levitt). Brian cant remember what happened to him when he was younger but he knows something bad happened. Neil on the other hand remembers every second of what happened and has let that take control of his life. The story continues to show Brian as a nerdy kid trying to find out what happened to him and Neil turns into a hustler. But in the end the horrifying truth comes out and their lives are changed forever.When this film ended, I just stood there and said wow that was really messed up and I felt depressed. The story is so raw and graphic. I dont think I saw anything this graphic since I first saw Irreversible a few years back. The movie feels so real and the events that occur to these two kids seem so common in todays society. I think it really hits home and thats why this film works so well.The lead performances by Brady Corbet and Joseph Gordon Levitt are terrific. Both are extremely believable and well acted. Its nice how they each played a character so different from one another. After watching Levitt in this film, Manic and Latter Days, I am pretty convinced that the guy is one hell of an actor although he needs to stick to the independent films. And the same thing goes for Brady Corbet who starred in my favorite film two years back called Thirteen. Also I feel its necessary to comment on Michelle Trachtenberg here who played Neils partner in crime Wendy. I really dont like Mrs. Trachtenberg probably because I saw her in the godawful Euro Trip and in Buffy however in this movie she was pretty good. I think she played the supporting role well.Gregg Araki was both the writer and director on the film. I must say the man knows how to make a graphic and disturbing film. The movie at times is hard to watch because of how disturbing some of the scenes are. I havent seen any of Mr. Arakis other films but I have been reading online and have heard that this is his masterpiece. I cant really say that I liked the film because this isnt a movie you come out of and say oh yea that was wonderful! You kind of come out of the theater saying man that was really f*cked up, kind of like the movie Thirteen although this movie is much more graphic. Its a great work of art as far as film goes and tells a deep and disturbing story well. The thing like I mentioned above that makes the film work is that this type of stuff happens in the world today which again is why Thirteen worked. Its shocking and disturbing but its only that way because it feels and seems real.In the end, I think its a really good movie with powerful performances and a great story. The movie is not for the weak hearted. I myself felt a bit disturbed by the film. The subject matter isnt very happy and neither is the story. The film is extremely graphic and raw. Some of the more disturbing scenes seem to run on for a long time which means that the film is working on its audience. I cant really pick a target audience for this film but if you like movies that are real and raw then you should check this out. This is a great movie that I think many would not be able to handle but for the few who can I think it really delivers.Movie Man Menzels final rating for Mysterious Skin is a 9/10.",True
"Wonderful Sting Film with a Twist!Anyone who thinks director Ridley Scott doesnt have a gentler side (after all, GLADIATOR, HANNIBAL, and BLACK HAWK DOWN are not exactly touchyfeely movies) may be in for a surprise with his latest, MATCHSTICK MEN. The story of extremely neurotic but brilliant con man Nicolas Cage (Im not a criminal, he explains to his shrink, Criminals hurt people; I dont...), discovering a daughter he never knew he had (Alison Lohman, of WHITE OLEANDER), on the eve of a big Sting, offers as much emphasis on his acceptance of his new parental responsibilities as on the caper he and his partner (the always watchable Sam Rockwell) are pulling off. Cage plays the role brilliantly, making his quirky character sympathetic, and Scott proves again why he is one of Hollywoods premier directors.The success of a film like this depends on the chemistry between the leads, and Cage and Lohman are terrific together. The young actress manages to be sweet without being innocent, and the tentative steps she and Cage take to understand each other are both believable, and touching. In one scene, he attempts to prove to her that he can cook by preparing a spaghetti dinner...after one bite, the scene shifts to the arrival of the Dominos delivery boy!Ultimately, however, MATCHSTICK MEN is a tale of The Con, and Cage and Rockwells Sting against fat cat Bruce Mc Gill, while appearing deceptively simple, has a series of twists and turns, leading to a climax that is both stunning and unexpected. This is the kind of movie that will have you putting pieces together, LONG after it ends.It is an intriguing and rewarding film, and shouldnt be missed!",False
"Another thoughtprovoking Peter Joseph film.Zeitgeist addendums venus project chapter, seemed rushed, utopian and just flat out hippie nonsense. Moving forward approaches the subject in a more grown up and sensible manner. I cant believe Im saying this, but youve made a believer out of me. But inherently that is where the problem lies. I live in Greece and things are pretty dire at the moment. And because of that fact Ive become a bit of an analyst and investigator. Hence my viewing of this film and appreciating the message. To sum up, because of the present situation, Im more susceptible to this type of proposal and to change in general. I hope Im wrong, but i dont think that this film will have a mass appeal in societies that are well off at the present. And thats where this type of change needs to be instigated. Solely for that reason I gave it 8*. Otherwise it would have been a flat 10. I recommend multiple viewings before critiquing this one...UPDATE: Now, two months after moving forward premiered, after heeding my own advice, I fully understand both Addendum and Moving Forward. I give both 10/10. Nice to see, finally, recognition from mainstream media (mainly Russia today).",True
Elegant This movie is elegant. The performances are magnificent. John Malkovich is totally believable as the sector that destroys the life of countless naive women. Glenn Close is amazing as one of the greatest bitches of the story of cinema. Michelle Pfeiffer and Keanu Reeves gave their best performances ever and Uma Thurman is amazing with a tremendous mix of innocence and sexuality. The script and the direction really made an amazing job giving an environment of sickness and degradation. The makeup and the beautiful costumes only aggregate the force that the story needed to be told. An amazing movie you really wish to enter in that snakes nest. Highly recommended.,False
"J Ks biggest book to the screen, mission impossible?  Mission accomplished!!!For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word how. How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.This seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also, the heart and soul of the book, i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowlings shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government, elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.Most readers will come out of the theater saying I wish they had shown this or that. However, all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a good watch but in this one we get a great movie.We have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a nonreader and she was, to say the least, blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration, our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.A few highlights: The acting is best ever. The three principles push themselves to a new level. My favorite new characters were Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge, excellent (youll love to hate her) and Natalia Tena as Tonks. Natalia is sheer delight. She is the penultimate punk rock witch girl(think Dead Milkmen here). And Helena Bonham Carter is in her medium (she played the witch Morganna in the movie Merlin) as the dangerous and demented Bellatrix Le Strange.Battle scenes: breathtaking. Commraderie: The only HP that actually caused me to get teary so heartfelt are the portrayals of friendship and family.See the film knowing that unless you want a 10hour movie some things are going to have to go. Leave having enjoyed a film that takes the beans and water and instead of a nice large coffee treats one to a perfectly concentrated, most artfully brewed and extremely tasty espresso. It has been said before but truth is truth: BEST YET!",True
"Yes it is garbage The theatregoer hoping to get some insight into Jimi Hendrix and London in 1966/67 will leave the theatre disappointed or duped by the film makers.Before seeing the film I was apprehensive, as I had been told that my character was portrayed in a derogatory and potentially defamatory manner. I had been told that Jimi had beaten me with a telephone in the film and after I had protested that this was not true the film makers had replied that it was true because they had thoroughly researched me.In other words they were saying that they were telling the truth and I was not.During the opening scenes I found it difficult to comprehend the way the story was unfolding, or what it was depicting. The editing was disjointed and dialogue was layered on top of alternate dialogue, seemingly from a parallel conversation.The film progressed in a confusing and dull manner but there was one scene that gave me a momentary lift of anticipation. The scene depicts Jimi playing with Cream at the Polytechnic Students Union and should have set out to depict an absolutely epic event that I had witnessed. (I had been carrying Jimis guitar).I hoped that they would do Jimi justice in their interpretation of what happened. Unfortunately, once the music started, my heart sank. What a disappointment. Not only was it insulting to Jimis legacy, but I would say it was fairly insulting to Eric Clapton as well because the real Eric Clapton would never have been in awe of the unremarkable performance presented to viewers in this film.The storyline progressed in an awkward and illogical way and was hard to comprehend.The basis seemed to be that the dimwitted Jimi could not make up his mind between the good rock chick (Linda Keith) and the bad rock chick (Kathy Etchingham) who later goes bonkers and takes an overdose. (If I was the actress having to play this lousy part wearing those ugly clothes I may have taken an overdose too.)The strange fact that jars with this fictional narrative is that, in reality, the unfortunate Linda Keith ended up in rehab at around this time because Keith Richards, of all people, initiated an intervention that probably saved her life. She was hardly in a position to be advising Jimi on how to play the guitar and do his hair.Fictional characters were introduced that furthered the deluded political, racial and sexist agenda that John Ridley seemed to be pursuing. In particular Michael X was presented as a saintly black political guru whereas in truth he was a violent criminal con man who was executed for a gruesome murder. An Ida character is introduced who never existed in real life.The biggest disappointment of this film was that after expecting at least some kind of depiction of Jimis humour and creativity and the amusing and creative times that were happening in London, instead we were shown a gloomy and depressing dark tale that pictured Jimi as some sort of moronic mumbling mystic with no ambition.Instead of showing Jimi touring the UK and Europe, writing and performing the most innovative music of the century we are shown scenes of banal mumblings, fictitious gratuitous violence and fictitious mental breakdowns and overdoses.My initial anxiety turned to scorn for the thoroughly bad screenplay and direction. I became bored and impatient for the end of the film.The fictional nature of the film left me feeling that the events I was watching were more akin to a made for DVD movie than a biopic.I felt that I wasnt watching an interpretation of the real events from the time, but rather a stiff and poorly depicted mashup of trivia from events described in my book, sprinkled over Ridleys racially driven fictional theme.Even the imaginary domestic violence, mental breakdown and drug use that my character was involved in did not evoke the emotional response I expected, and I found myself feeling just as I have when watching other bad movies, impatient for it to just finish and spare me the indignity of having to watch another tiresome scene with wooden dialogue and disjointed editing.A shortsighted and somewhat offensive portrayal of Jimi and those around him at the time.Final verdict: Fictional Movie – 2/10 Biopic purporting to be based in fact – 1/10 (for spelling all the names right)",False
"Exciting!What an exciting movie! I had absolutely no expectations of this film. I had never even heard of it when I came across it. Since Ive seen a lot of movies lately that have most often disappointed me, I thought this would be another one. But Im glad to say it wasnt. I have a hard time concentrating when watching movies, I often turn my attention to something else and because of that I get lost in the plot. Some movies though, manages to keep me focused on the movie the entire time and this was one of those movies. I love a good mystery, where the movie makes you really think. When you try to solve the mystery (this time, the question) yourself. So I stayed focused every minute and it never got boring. Its basically a riddle and if you think youre smart enough, watch it and see if you can come up with the right answer before the characters do! ;)I would definitely recommend this film to other people. Id give it a 7 or an 8.",False
"Absorbing Piece of Work Lets start with the good news. Born on the Fourth of July is an absorbing piece of work, based on a true story, about Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), a gungho Marineturnedwarprotester. We first meet Kovic as an all American boy as strong in his faith as he is in his will to succeed. After high school he proudly joins the Marines, hoping hell be shipped to Vietnam to stop the spread of communism. But the barbarities of war, including civilian casualties, friendly fire and a paralyzing bullet through the chest, gradually turn him against the conflict. Director Oliver Stones method of telling Kovics story over a period of several years is highly effective and convincing. Cruise is at his best as Kovic, portraying a wide range of emotions and developing apathy with the viewer. The audience feels what he feels, from confusion on the battlefield to the terror of being paralyzed from the waist down.Now for the bad news. The picture is overly political, with Stone once again (and unnecessarily) casting Republicans as the bad guys and Democrats as the good guys (seemingly ignoring that the Dems initially sent the troops to Nam). The film also takes a while to build up steam, and the all American life of the pre Marine Kovic seems a little too perfect to be believable. Obviously a story such as this requires adequate screen time, but the 145 minutes is slightly drawn out, particularly toward the end. And although one of its central themes is the opposition to the war that greeted returning vets, the genesis and rationale of that opposition are not adequately explored.As a whole, however, Born of the Fourth of July is recommended. Kovics biography and Stones masterful storytelling are a perfect match. Its not your typical war movie. In fact, its not your typical movie, period.",True
"A glittery glamrock piece of slash fanfiction Slash Fanfiction is when a person writes a story involving two (usually) males characters from a television show or movie in a homoerotic romantic relationship. And this is what Velvet Goldmine is.  A visually stunning, incredibly tasty piece of slash fanfiction.  But instead of Kirk & Spock or Mulder & Krycek, its someone whos a lot like David Bowie and someone whos a lot like Iggy Pop. Perhaps that appeals to you.  Perhaps it doesnt.  But despite its fanfiction feeling, this movie is absolutely visually stunning.  The imagery will last with you long after you leave the movie, your eyes blinking as you adjust to a rather grey drab world.  The movie isnt about substance, its about style; about creating and rearranging yourself to fit the time, to fit the world around you.  Its about fluidity, fluidity of gender, personality, ideas, and romance. Because, like all Slash fanfiction, above everything else, its a love story.",False
"Perhaps the most imaginative and entertaining nightmare ever put on film A virtual celebration of writer/director Terry Gilliams singular creative vision and seemingly limitless imagination, Brazil is a unique movie experience. And it is kind of hard to put the label of any one particular genre on the film; its generally referred to as dystopian science fiction (which certainly isnt wrong), but its also a satire, a drama, a black comedy and perhaps even a fantasy film. Like many other dystopian scifi films (e.g. Fahrenheit 451, Equilibrium, The Hunger Games), Brazil depicts a totalitarian society, but thats about as far as the similarities with other films go.The whole design of Brazils crazy world is unlike anything Ive ever seen in other movies (with the exception perhaps of those made by the same filmmaker). Where films with similar themes typically go for a futuristic look that is defined by all the technological advancements the writers and filmmakers can dream of, Terry Gilliam chooses the complete opposite direction. In his film, technology seems to have made no progress since somewhere around the forties or fifties, and what technology there is doesnt exactly look very reliable. And unlike other dystopian films, its not primarily the bleak aspects of a totalitarian society Gilliam wants to explore; in his film, he wants to show how hilariously insane, inept and ridiculous many of the mechanisms and instruments of oppression truly are. In that sense, Brazil is mainly a satire (at least thats how I perceive it), and it is often either darkly funny or downright hilarious.There is simply not a dull moment in the film: its a wild ride that never lets up and almost every image on the screen practically bursts with clever (often hilarious) details; from the way food is served in restaurants to how the benefits of plastic surgery are presented, Gilliams imagination can only be marveled at. His vision of a bureaucracy gone mad is probably the most entertaining nightmare ever put on film (Im talking about the directors cut, of course).

Yet there are comical and even idyllic moments. Mitchum is EXCELLENT, especially in the cellar scene. Subtle, different; not just the same old axafterax tearemup bloodandgore formula, but REAL suspense built from the personalities of the characters and the artful editing, music, art direction, and Charles Laughtons directing. Yet warm and lovely in parts. The casts characterizations are excellent, even in minor roles, such as the typical townspeople. Youll remember this one for a long time.

"It skillfully and dramatically  depicts  how our culture is now wellwoven into the INTERNET fabric, but the final wrapup scenes were oddly unbelievable The movie DISCONNECT, clearly and dramatically depicts how our culture is now wellwoven into the INTERNET fabric of reality. It is an intelligent and skillfully done film. The script is competent and well sculpted, with three simultaneous stories,but the final wrapup scenes were (storywise)oddly unbelievable, canned, premade, or off the shelf for lack of a better term.There is a large percentage of the population(i.e.my wife and I) that are not fully in tune (or dependent) on the current, internetlaced way of life, but I felt this movie effectively plugged us into understanding and relating to it.Although the film resides in the Arts & Entertainment category, it also can be perceived as a valuable, cinematographic coresample of the current culture and society,in ways that Easy Rider, The Best days of our lives, and others movies have done in the past.It shows thenowof our culture and society in humanistic, suspenseful, and moving ways.I highly recommend seeing the film if you have the time.",True
"Compelling storytelling Inspired by real events, The Believer tells the story of a young Jewish man who is contradicted by his beliefs in neonazism.  Ryan Gosling (Remember the Titans) plays Danny Balint, a Jew by birth and upbringing, whos ideas about the religion lead him into a world of denial and hate.  Flashbacks show the viewer how Danny struggled with his early teachings of the faith and his lack of understanding would result in his decision to be a practicing, racehating skinhead.Along the way, Danny meets up with Lina and Curtis played graciously by Theresa Russell and Billy Zane who want to recruit Danny and use his persuasive talents to advance their cause as fascists.  It is in his first meeting with this couple that Danny also meets Carla (Summer Pheonix), a confused young girl who eventually befriends Danny and soon begins her quest to best understand the Jews through their language and traditions.In a later scene, Danny finds himself at a white supresmist training camp and meets other skinheads with the same hatred and desire to rid themselves of the Jewish population.  Danny befriends the group and garnishes their respect with his fighting tactics, and on one fateful night, the group land themselves in jail after initiating a fight with two blacks on the street.It is here that the most disturbing and challenging scene of the movie takes place where the group is forced by the courts to enter counselling for their crime.  This counselling would include Jews who survived the holocust who tell their story to the unappreciated skinhead audience.  While the others argue that the Holocost never occurred, Danny is haunted by the story of an elderly man who tells of a German Soldier who stabbed and killed his son with a bayonette during World War II.This then leads Danny down two separate paths.  On one side, he is a race hating monger, who begins to build bombs for the purpose of blowing up a synagogue.  The other, a conflicted man of the Judaism faith who teaches Hebrew to his girlfriend and still practices the basics of the religion (dont light the candles at Yom Kippur before eating).
Director/writer Henry Bean does a masterful job of keeping the pace of the movie going, while not being preachy or dumbing down to the audience. The director crafts the film and does not shy away from religious interpretations (why can Jews have cheese with meat, but they can have chicken with milk), without giving us his version of the answers.  Dannys scene with the reporter from the New York Times is both honest and gripping in its language and its portrayal of a man trying to justify his racist views.Portrayed as an articulate and intelligent youth, Ryan Gosling sparkles on the screen and gives a commanding presence that is award winning material. He reveals the character to be someone of higher intelligence who hates his religion because he just cant understand all its principles.  When Danny is first confronted with an opportunity to kill a Jew, he cant bring himself to promote the results that he preaches.In short, the movie has powerful moments, great acting and tells an unbelievable story of one mans quest to understand the world he was brought up in.

"Why cant American movie makers make a movie this great?You dont need to know the plot to understand that this movie has all of the magic of true arta wonderful story, an actress and director seemingly out of nowhere, and a cinematic style that is dramatic and completely engrossing and satisfying. What is amazing is that this film shows how American cinema has completely lost its touch. In the old studio days young American actresses, and actresses from around the world were somehow discovered and developed. When is the last time that has happened in Hollywood? Our movie machine is run by a bunch of bean counters that dont know art from bank notes, casting the same tired names over and over again in endless overblown works of absolute drivel.

"Mesmerizing and haunting tale of love, greed, regret, betrayal and revenge This is, for me, one of the finest examples of cinematic art. It isnt a simple, cutndried 90 minute little package that gets wrapped up with a pretty bow at the end. You get pulled in by the enigmatic opening that unwinds the threads of the story to be found later. For many people having half an hour of purely visual story telling, of stories that are only mysteries at that point, before anything becomes truly linear is difficult to follow and discourages to many people. Our own memories are only snippets that only become linear as we concentrate on scenes from our lives. Once Upon a Time in America is like that as we follow Noodles through the `significant part of his life  the times that formed him. When the story actually starts, we meet the girl that he always loved but could never have.David `Noodles Aaronson (De Niro) was a kid on the very mean streets of Brooklyn when organized crime was born in America and he grew into and out of it. Thats the simplest synopsis of the plot. The reality is that this isnt a movie about gangsters. Being a gangster is the easiest way for Noodles to survive and get ahead, but it also alienates and ruins his one love. Whenever he is close to giving himself to Deborah he always gets pulled back into the gang, in some form or another.De Niros portrayal is of a gangster, through and through, who also has a conscience that, while not preventing him from being a ruthless killer, rules his life with regret, remorse and guilt. Leone takes a bit of poet/historic license by showing the Brooklyn Bridge being built in the background (the bridge had been built 40 years before), but it symbolizes Noodles own growth. When the bridge is just pilings and incomplete towers, Noodles is just forming his future. By the time the bridge is complete, Noodles is nothing but a gangster and the bridge is majestic. When he returns 35 years later our view of the bridge is from under a freeway  the world has moved along, but the bridge and Noodles are just as they were.The length: If youre looking for a brief distraction that youll barely remember 30 minutes later, this isnt the movie for you. However, if you are prepared and able to be undistributed for the nearly 4 hours that this film uses to compress a lifetime  you will be rewarded with many facets of thought and examination.",True
"An erotically superb adventure of deception and action with a brilliant script and twist Wild Things absolutely wowed me the first time I watched it. I had no knowledge of what it was about, actually, and so I had no knowledge of what to expect. When I saw it for the first time I just had to watch it a second time right after that, to be honest, because I was astounded at how much I enjoyed it. Although I did not own the movie, you know that I went back to rent it a couple of more times because it was just so wonderful, and finally when I got the chance to buy it, I did, and now I have watched it numerous times on numerous occasions because it truly is an excellent movie that I can enjoy with every watch.Each actor and actress had a amazing role and they performed it with excellent expertise; I loved all the performances and they were all so fun and precise with the character they were given that in the long run they make the characters that would normally have been dull and uninteresting awesome and unable to look away from. The way every single line and move was so suspenseful and or clever and it just clicked all into place made my heart sink deeper into the story and never look away; I really was entertained to the point where I could not take my eyes off the screen for how amazing it was. As a Neve Campbell and Denise Richards fanatic, I enjoyed them and their luminous roles, as well as Matt Dillon who was awesome. I thought the way each and every twist and turn in the plot was just so great that my eyes lingered on for more after it was over, which is why of course I watched it a second time, and the only problem I had with this movie is that it was not long enough, though if it had have been longer I do not think it would have worked out for the better or anything, if you understand what I am trying to say. This movie is simply great, so wonderful; I would watch it over and over again if I had to simply because it is so fantastic and I really got into the way there was a major turning point at the ending that blows your mind, as well as the twist halfway through the film. It is magnificent, with unforgettable performances and a great story line. I would recommend you see it immediately if you can stand the subject matter.",False
"Of all the movies in theatres to see, this is worth your time I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average filmgoer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer.",True
"A masterpiece Previously known only for creating The Monkees, Bob Rafelson produced an underrated masterpiece when he made Five Easy Pieces, a film that deserves to be a lot better known.  Jack Nicholson, typically intense but atypically understated, has possibly his finest hour as Bobby Duprea, a selfhating misogynist ill at ease with himself and the world.  Many people will, when thinking of Nicholson, bring to mind his pantomime pyschopath Johnny from The Shining; but Bobby, a profoundly human creation, is actually far more scary.  Elsewhere the film features characteristically gorgeous cinematography from Laszlo Kovaks; a soundtrack that skilfully offsets Tammy Wynette and Chopin; excellent writing throughout and some very black humour. Like a less extreme version of Mike Leighs Naked, and bristling with uncomfortable truth, Five Easy Pieces is a true classic of 1970s cinema. Few films today are as good.",False
"takes on the egotistical qualities in artists and gangsters in Allens very funny sendup of Broadway Now this is something sort of rare, though not really: Woody Allen mixing satire and drama, and the satire actually even more convincing than the drama. The opposite was in a more serious affair, Crimes and Misdemeanors, where art and murder and infidelities all get into one big pot of personality crises. This is the same case with Bullets Over Broadway, though this time Allens tackling of the egomaniacal crutches of the Broadway scene the aging star Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest, one of her very best performances, funniest too), the bumbling boob Olive Neal (Jennifer Tilly, appropriately annoying and then how it sort of infects the outsiders to the major Broadway scene, one the protagonist David Shayne (John Cusack, excellent here), and Olives bodyguard, Cheech (Chazz Palminteri, a character he could play in his sleep, but played pretty well anyway). Cheech is hanging around during rehearsals of Davids first play hes writing and directing, following getting funding (on the condition of Olive as a psychiatrist) from a heavyduty mobster, and soon hes suggesting ideas, and in the process becomes Davids uncredited collaborator. But meanwhile infidelities are abound, with David falling for the wonderfully selfindulgent Helen, and a goofy romance between Olive and the thespian Warner Purcell (Jim Broadbent), leading to a purely ironic climax.Allens skills at navigating the neuroses of all the characters is very skilled, and sometimes the oneliners are surprisingly funny, all based on the personalities (Wiesst especially, in a voice that is a little startling at first, gives a classic line about the world opening up, and her running gag with dont speak). Even with the more dramatic connections, which doesnt seem to be as much of Allens concerns since its pretty onenote with the mob side of things (and, frankly, the fates of Olive and Cheech sort of seem a little too contrived for the sake of the irony par for the course), we do get a very memorable bit to make things worth the while, like David and Cheechs down to earth talk at the bar. But if theres anything else to recommend more strongly its for the sharpness of the script in the theater scenes, the backstage banter, the hilarious tension stirred up by grudges and illtimed romances. Plus, theres a bit of an added treat for fans of past Allen films, where he casts Rob Reiner in a role sort of similar to that of Wallace Shawn in Manhattan. Not a masterpiece, but a very enjoyable work thats successful on its darklight terms.",False
"At long last, a ballisticsfree espionage film with an actual storyline I caught this movie at the Century Napa Valley Theater(they have a wine bar...naturlich!)after work yesterday while waiting for the homeward bound traffic to die down. Its terrific. A story about German spooks in Hamburg (Mohamed Atas launch pad) setting a trap for a suspected terrorist financier, and not a single shot is fired, no one is killed, no dead bodies, no impossible martial arts acrobatics and no amazing shots of bullets frozen in mid air. In other words, an actual story via the maestro John le Carre. The ending is really infuriating, but probably representative of how a lot of these efforts have ended up since 9/11. Philip Seymour Hoffman is over the top as the head spook. Im sure going to miss him.Unusually, all the main characters are played by American/Canadian actors. Not a single Brit or Aussie and Germans only in supporting roles. Another reason its a real oneoff.Check it out!",False
"A good concept that was done right This is a true sequel: it expands on a previous story and makes it better. American Pie was never a great film and the many reincarnations of the same story did not do it good, but American Reunion almost fixes everything, giving it a true human dimension. In my opinion, it is this film that makes American Pie a classic. I just hope they dont turn it into another franchise. Let it rest, people! You got it right, dont mess with it.Other than that, the same crazy antics, part felony, part madness and the same awkward situations, but with a more adult touch. Everybody is married, with children, but at heart, they are still kids. That is what this film is all about.",False
"Smart and funny with a sense of style, pure Woody Allen. *** out of ****.SMALL TIME CROOKS / (2000) ***	Woody Allens artistic sense of humor is the perfect style of wit for the timid new comedy Small Time Crooks. Allen wrote and directed the film, which is pure Allen. This amusing  filmmaker brings a focused sensation of clumsiness and silliness to the various ensemble of characters; this movie is classy, sharp, and funny. 	Woody Allen stars as an excon named Ray Winkler, currently employed as a local dishwasher. He is the kind of person who comes up with maniac ideas he explains as beneficial, but they end up causing more grief than gratitude. His mangy wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman) is sick of her loser lifestyle, so when Ray proposes to burglarize a nearby bank with his old buddies, including Denny (Michael Rapaport), Tommy (Tony Darrow), and Benny (Jon Lovitz), she reluctantly agrees.	Ray comes up with a scheme that consists of renting a storefront next to the bank in order to tunnel a passage way into their destination. To avoid suspicion, Frenchy and her cousin May (Elaine May) open a bakery offering cookies as the four criminals screw everything up in the basement. The cookie sales unexpectedly become a massive achievement, leading to the characters opening up a corporation that makes them rich.
The films setup introduces the main characters with intelligent humor and riffraff detail. We learn they are unintelligent, desperate, and deprived nobodies living in unmistakable poverty without purpose or hope of a decent future. Also decently developed is the story, with a clear, stable first act and early laughs to capture the audiences attention from the start. This is the kind of movie that relies on situations to pull its characters through the story, and Allen gives the script fresh twists, active subplots, and creativity.Small Time Crooks is a character movie; a study of wellacted personas given funny edge and dimension. The characters are dazzlingly portrayed by some of the most clever names in Hollywood. Woody Allen rehearses his basic charismatic personality that we all know and love, and brackets himself between witty dialogue and wellcast supporting actors. Tracey Ullman is perfect in a role seemingly prepared towards her performance and Hugh Grants false charming tenderness creates a despicable image in which the audience opposes but enjoys.The movies story clearly exhibits the life of Ray and Frenchy, which is probably the smartest level in which it succeeds. We see gradual changes in the two as the story uses side characters as benchmarks that help to propel the plot along. There is minute tension involved with Ray and his spouse, however, although the Hugh Grant character provides a little romantic competition. If I had to change something in this movie, I would increase the level of the storys stakes and change the horridly annoying soundtrack.
	Too much of this movie relies on dialogue to pull itself through story slouches; at times the plot seems to drift and the character end up explaining developments and advancements. Small Time Crooks does not suffer to immensely in result of this material because Woody Allen often supports his dialogue with visual story and amusing conversations that look as if especially written for each character in each scene.
Small Time Crooks furnishes seeking audiences with effective comedy. So often we desire for comic adventures only to find contrived and recycled humor in stale stories. This film succeeds in perspiring lighthearted humor with a surprising human dimensional touch. Small Time Crooks will not disappoint fans of Woody Allens gawky sense of humor.",True
"Spectacular spectacular Growing up I always had a pretty utopian view on what being a teenager in high school would be like. Once I got there, it was nothing like what I had thought, and plus we had no kids that looked like James Spader. Just because high school was not like a John Hughes film didnt make it a bad thing, I just think I would have had more fun at those schools than mine. Now a day in the perfect world is not what people want, they want something real, and in The Spectacular Now it feels like what being a teenager feels like today.Now being a middleaged man this is only a guess, but it sure feels right on. Sutter (Miles Teller) is that guy everyone likes, you know the life if any party. Sutter is enjoying every minute of high school, great times, and a great girlfriend named Cassidy (Brie Larson) to top it off. Sutter also likes to drink, and not the typical teenage drinking, he goes as far as carrying a flask and even putting alcohol in anything he drinks. After Cassidy breaks up with him, Sutter drinks a little too much and ends up passed out in the front of a house, not his own. He is found by Aimee (Shailene Woodley), who knows Sutter from school. Sutter starts to gather interest in Aimee, but all the while hoping to land back with the women he thinks he wants in Cassidy. Aimee has never had a boyfriend and quickly starts to fall for Sutter hard. With school ending soon, Sutter is all about the now, and has no idea what his future will hold, he never wants to grow up, because where is the fun in that? A lot of people think that their high school years were their highest point in their life. I mean you have no worries, no responsibilities, you just live life. Everything is easier, including love because how innocent everything is. Sutter and Aimee are at that point where things start to move, college and life are in front of them making them have to make choices they never had to before. Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber (500 Days of Summer) from the book by Tim Tharp, the story is a real coming of age story. I know that is a bad description, but where so many coming of age stories fail, this one soars. It is all perfectly directed by James Ponsoldt (Smashed), who set the movie in his home town of Athens, Georgia, and even shot the film in locations he grew up in. It all comes together by the flawless performances by Woodley and Teller who are perfect for each other on screen. I sometimes think what it would be like to grow up in this day and age, well I think I just got to see what life is like today and like this movie it looks spectacular.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",True
"Its fun Summer Fare, Enjoy !I saw the Broadway play with the original cast and had a great time. The movie didnt disappoint me either. A cheesy love story tied together with great music from the hair band 80s was on purpose. Reliving that era, priceless. Go. Enjoy. This will definitely become a cult favorite in future years, bless em for preserving some amazing rock history. Ignore the professional critics, go have fun!This is my first review attempt on IM Db, with hopes this helps those who are turned off by People, EW, local and national news professional (aka, paid) reviewers.

"I Know a Thing or Two, About a Thing or Two.This Boys Life was the break out role for Leonardo Di Caprio who proved what a great talent he was in this coming of age film. He had to be to hold his own with Robert De Niro. De Niro with his great ear for voices and accents perfectly captures the role of stepfather Dwight Hansen, a man with a terrible inferiority complex who takes it out on his stepson.The film is based on the memoirs of writer Tobias Wolff as he and his mother endured five years of hell with this very provincial man who is trapped in the small town mentality of Concrete, Washington during the 1950s. The title quote is from De Niro who repeats that line many times during the film. In fact thats all he does is talk in clichés and its made abundantly clear that his level of ignorance about the outside world is frightening.That puts him in contrast with stepson Di Caprio whos a bright kid and capable of going places with some guidance. De Niro isnt about to provide that guidance, hes just plain jealous of him.In fact This Boys Life is similar in that respect to the Tom Cruise film All the Right Moves where Cruise is also trying to escape the drab life he sees in his small Pennsylvania mining town through athletics and meets with jealousy from many around him, but not in his own family circle.This Boys Life should be required viewing on the effects of homophobia. In addition to the principal players, De Niro, Di Caprio, and Ellen Barkin as Di Caprios mother, credit should go to Jonah Blechman who played gay teen Arthur Gayle. Hes got a real lonely existence in Concrete, Washington. Arthurs story is still unfortunately being acted out today in thousands of small town throughout the USA. He gravitates to Di Caprio, not just sexually, but because he recognizes a kindred spirit there.Among other things De Niro encourages is homophobia as homosexuality is one of many things hes ignorant about and prefers to remain so. Its quite a scene in which De Niro encourages Di Caprio to beat up Arthur on any and all occasions.In fact thats ultimately Dwights problem. Its maybe ONLY two things that he knows anything about and can converse intelligently on. And hes living in a town full of other Dwights as ignorant as he is.This is one of the best films of the last decade of the last century and should not be missed.",False
"A Cult Classic I never saw Death Becomes Her when it first come out because of a review I had read somewhere. The review was dismissive and made a lot of sense, so I decided to give it a miss. What a terrible mistake! This is a movie I would love to see on a big screen. The script is so brilliantly clever. Disguised as a silly comedy there is a world of serious themes executed by a knowing cast. Meryl Streep in particular, playing convincingly an actress without talent. I remember the bad review criticized the writers for setting the story in a rainy, stormy Los Angeles when California was going through a drought. Imagine if a comedy about magic potions should worry about the accuracy of the weather. In fact the Los Angeles of Death Becomes Her feels more like Los Angelers than most realistic movies and it does it with nerve and wit. In 12 years in Los Angeles have you ever seen a neighbor? screams Meryl to his mousy Bruce. An absolute delight. Other hidden treasures are a cameo from Sidney Pollack and a very funny and very sexy 76 years old Isabella Rossellini. A new cult classic and a total must.",True
"Something Special I didnt want to like it. Despite what you may think I dont want to like movies like this . I hate myself for it. But theres such an overwhelming charm when things are executed just right and I just cant help it. Pitch Perfect centers on Becca played the emerging star Anna Kendrick (in a role which will solidify her status if it its as big as it deserves ) a freshman at college. Her father is a professor and shes angsty and rebellious. After a brief set up we enter the unknown world of acapella singing, Which is singing with no instruments. Apparently a huge thing at this college and we meet different groups there well 2 mostly the troublemakers an all male group that always slays the competition and the Bellas who churn out the same old fashioned nonsense and are recovering from a year that didnt end well to say the least. After some persuasion Becca joins the Bellas looking to add some of her much needed zest to liven up the competition.Im sure you can guess what happens and its no lie that the film is formulaic in that way. However, the approach to the material is what differentiates it. Its handled with an original, saucy, smart originality. it doesnt downplay its focus but instead celebrates it in all its corny glory. The film takes a little getting used to but about half way through i was so sold on all the wonderful characters and the films undeniable charm. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say ts flawless its a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snows character feels a little confusing. But its easy to overlook the small stuff when the film is so entertaining.",False

"In a 60s party mood  no more.. but no less, either Although the film received its fair share of criticism for its historical inaccuracies and feeble plot, in my view, the film does exactly what its authors set out to achieve and  not only in terms of the soundtrack  rock it really does.If youre looking for an evening of pure escapist fun, feeling generally nostalgic and cool about the legacy of the 60s fashion and music, and would like to forget history for a while and go with the party mood, go see this film  you wont be let down and youll get what youre looking for: an amazing soundtrack (although, as many didnt hesitate to point out, not entirely historically accurate), with the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, Dusty Springfield, The Hollies, Jimmy Hendrix, Buddy Holly, and many many more, with the charismatic Bill Nighy and a bunch of other notquitesoordinary eccentric characters, more or less familiar to you, depending on how you enjoy British (and American) comedy (e.g. IT Crowd). Even if you dont know the actors, even if youre not into the music of the 60s, youve got pure feelgood fun thrown in to top it off for a great evening of the 60s Rockn Roll partying. And its partying in the true 60s sense of the word.On the other hand, if youre looking for profound plot development, historical accuracy and consistency, or a true story of a real pirate radio station Caroline that inspired the story, or, in fact, would like to see a true depiction of the life in the UK in 1966, do NOT go see this film, because you might leave disappointed.Its as simple as that.So, a definite recommendation for cinema viewing because of the necessary volume that the speakers allow you there to enjoy the music to the fullest (and, let me say one more time what music it is!), but stay out if youre not in a party mood.I give it 8/10 for the feelgood, cool entertainment it brings and.... well, for the Rockn Roll.Have fun!",False
"I recently blew the dust off of my copy and watched it againAnd I cant believe I never threw my two cents in about this one. When I first saw Angel Heart, I thought it was going to be your regular old mystery. Like a Mamet or Spillane yarn about a down on his luck private investigator drawn into a web of lies and deceit Oh yeah, it IS like that and then some.  I was completely drawn into this movie. I found it perfectly paced. And just like other movies of this type, could not see the end coming at all. However from the beginning it felt like something was kind of different about THIS yarn. I couldnt quite put my finger on it. Kind of like the feeling you get as your walking out of the house and you just know you forgot something but you cant remember what. It was like that, a nagging at the back of your brain feeling. And then, oh boy! When all is revealed you wish you would have just left without what ever it was you were missing,  cause what you find is ohso frightening.  What a terribly wonderful story and what great direction.

"Saying Goodbye to Hogwarts... In a Good Way As many people have already seen, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is out in Theaters. I will not spoil this film for you if you have not seen it yet. I will let you form your own conclusions as to whether you wish to see it or not.As everyone knows, this is the last film in the Harry Potter franchise, started 10 years ago with Mr. Chris Columbus at the helm. Many people credit the third film of the series, Prisoner of Azkaban, as the moment the franchise went from made for children to a more mainstream, mature audience. I have to give major credit to Mr. Columbus though as without him, the visions, actors, and feel of what we know within the films would not have been created. Several years later, we are at the end of an epic journey. We have laughed, cried, looked on with awe and inspiration. Mr. David Yates returns to his role and directs a wonderful end to J.K. Rowlings loved works of literature. To explain how I felt while watching this film is difficult to achieve. I was enthralled from the opening scene to the start of the credits. Very few films capture me like that where I am so in tuned with the story. Star Trek (2009), Inception, and Avatar are a few of the movies in which I have found myself repeat visits due to wanting to see parts of the movie that I have missed along the way. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride starting off slow, until you reach the first action sequence, then rushes headstrong into another series of scenes, focusing mostly on Harry and his charge of destroying the horcruxes. This is Harrys story. This is his moment to set the wizarding world right. Along the way, several characters stand out. Nevil Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) makes a stand and Professor Mc Gonagall goes to war. There are many moments in which supporting cast members take the foreground for a moment or two, but it is still Harrys story throughout the movie.I have to applaud Alan Rickman for his portrayal of Professor Snape. He has always amused me in every movie and he doesnt fail here. Another film to see how great of an actor he is (besides Die Hard and Galaxy Quest); Bottle Shock.Now, was it a perfect movie. No. The CG at points looked amateurish and some of the dialog didnt fit well into the movie. Does it deter you from enjoying the experience. It shouldnt. These are just little things that annoy me.If you read the books, which I am sure most of you have, the story doesnt follow the book as well as it did in Part 1. I have yet to see any movie adaption of a well loved book ever faithfully follow the book to the letter. Even Game of Thrones didnt follow the books to the letter, but it did a good job. Enjoy the movie for what it is: A satisfactory end to a magical, coming of age, story.",False
"Pleasantly delightful... or delightfully pleasant I find all of woody allen flicks interesting. Always an interesting subject no matter how good bad ugly great the movie is. This new one is no exception.MITM is a totally pleasant whimsical delight... the actors are charming especially Emma Stone and Eileen Atkins as Colin Firths aunt. The humor is very light... whimsy is a good term... is it funny? For me NO... but its also not unfunny. Its just this one long smile.The scenery is gorgeous.The story is smart hidden in a cute jacket. The age difference between the two is maybe a tad much but the rom in this romcom is not the leading factor... at least for most of it. Maybe a Colin Firth from 15 years ago would have been a better lead but unless Woody has access to that time travel device in Midnight In Paris that was not an option. As with some other Allen films there is a turn in direction at some point. Wont give anything away. Your enjoyment of the movie might hinge on how you feel after it goes after this point.For me it may have lingered around too long towards the end. Firth is good and likable but I did find some of his characters decisions to be too abrupt. But maybe thats just me. And some of his duologue felt a bit rushed and acted. I wouldnt personally rank this as one of his recent greats like Paris, Jasmine, Match Point or VCB... but its a fun summery concoction of scenery, whimsy and costumes.",True
"Fantastic Bro Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to Di Caprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorseses direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where Di Caprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated.",True

The scathing insults are dished out so heavily, yet supported so convincingly by actual footage backing their standpoint, it is compelling viewing. The calm and reasonable tones of the host and translator are soothingly believable, making this film either a shocking indictment of our era or one the most brilliant pieces of Propaganda in a generation. Either way, this film is compelling viewing.",False
"The Most Clever Horror Movie Ever!Not only does this movie create an extremely tense atmosphere the moment it starts, it has plenty of gore and violence to bombard your eyes, not to mention that it has one of the best twists seen in any horror movie.I watched this film alone at night with the lights off, expecting to be freaked out by it since I thought it was just another typical horror movie; but instead I was completely intrigued by the story line, and utterly drawn into the film for the whole 100 minutes. At the end I did not feel scared, rather, I felt something very few horror movies have to offer: satisfaction! This movie left me in a slightly disturbed but very thoughtful state. It did not give me nightmares, rather, it plagued my daydreams; for two days my thoughts could not stray far from this film, thats how powerful it is.If you want a cringingly gory and violent horror movie, watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Hostel; if you want a nightmarishly scary horror movie, watch The Grudge or The Ring; if you want a clever and disturbing horror movie with an excellent story and a great twist, watch Saw.",False
"The subject is undeserving and unexamined but the delivery is engagingly overthetop Bronson is the story of a very violent man, a man with clear mental issues that have gained him the infamous title of the most violent criminal in the UK; he is undeserving of attention on the scale this film gives him and the idea that he is somehow pleased with the film or that it has earned him fame is something that sat uneasy with me while watching and continues to sit uneasy with me afterwards. Morally I wondered why I came to the film and also why it was made; director Refn certainly doesnt seem bothered by this though and indeed did himself no favours by famously illegally taping the real mans comments on the film for broadcast at the premiere. So with this in mind it is hard to swallow a film that doesnt seems to have a certain apathy towards the central character – not a great choice of word perhaps but, while the film doesnt go as far as admiring Bronson, it certainly doesnt condemn him or present him in a way that will revile an audience.Having said that though, what Refn seems to have done is created this film where Bronson tells us his own story. This allows for a soft touch (as it is his own) but also for this violently compulsive mind to create and fill the film so that he is equally a larger than life character while also being quite terrifying in his snaps and swings. The result of this approach is not a film that is to be relied on for the facts of the story but it is one that really delivers a quite dizzying film in terms of borrowed styles, impact, violence and sheer overthe top bravado. It is hard to really process because on one hand this was a problem for me but on the other it actually worked very well to produce a film that is as much a monster as its subject – and the kind part of me wants to believe that this was the point.If it was then it is successful in some way because it is a beast of a film that comes at you violently and persistently. This is not all praise perhaps, but this is what it does. Depending on your point of view, Refns direction either pays homage or rips off plenty of others as he throws visual styles and flairs at the screen as if he never thought hes make another film. There are countless reference points are in here if you want them, but for sure Clockwork Orange is what he is going for and I suppose in some way the sheer energy with which he goes after it is commendable. It is not his style and it doesnt make you forget the failings in substance, but it is engaging as pure style. Matching him step for step in this regard is an incredibly ballsy performance from Hardy. It is worth noting that I do not think it is great when it comes to character or intelligence but these failings are in the material, not with Hardy – he follows his director and he deserves a lot of credit for not flinching from anything. He is intense but yet flamboyant, disturbed but yet disturbing, a nice bloke but yet a hideous monster – and it is all done with 100% conviction. His Bronson is not a wellcrafted character but (rightly or wrongly) he isnt meant to be and Hardy hammers home what he has been given.Bronson is not an easy watch. For one reason it features strong violence, language and nudity that may put some off, but the much bigger reason for me was the lack of morality within the construct of the story. The lead character is allowed to tell his own story and as he twists it with his ego, so the whole film is twisted by his ego – Bronson as a man doesnt deserve this done on his behalf and it sat uneasy with me. The saving grace though is that the whole thing is excessive and fullon from the director, an approach which in turn draws an intense and bravely excessive performance from Hardy that makes this really worth watching even if it has a lot of problems in it and around it.",False
"Its the little things that tell you youve found quality!I rented this film cold at the video store  and was very pleasantly surprised with a very well done movie. If you dont know anything else about Gattaca, the less you know, the better. Stop reading this review right now, go watch it, and come back when youre done!It was after my first viewing of the film that several little details dawned on me:1) The term borrowed ladder is a utterlybrilliantlyconceived bit of future slang that carries a *double meaning*. Im still amazed that the producers didnt make more of this. Instead, they were content to leave this gem to be discovered by the thinking and missed by the vast masses. I was very definitely impressed. 2) As I was explaining the film to my wife, it occurred to me in midexplanation that this is really a film that has to do with what is properly called =eugenics=; one of the things the Nazis were about. Then my mind wandered to word etymologies: I recalled that the name Eugene = well born. And then I realized...!!!3) Its interesting the extent to which so many of the characters in the film *didnt* live up to their genetic destiny, one way or another.4) Because I hadnt seen any previews, I had no immediate reference for where the name Gattaca had come from. And then I suddenly realized...!!!5) It wasnt until I watched the movie the second time that I caught the effects with the title sequence letters...Now I had figured out by this time that there were likely to be other intriguing little details Ive missed, so I was fascinated to read from another reviewer here about the boy Vincent falling with a toy rocket in his hand. I wonder what else is in there?All in all, this is a very well written, tightly woven movie. Seen cold, with no real prior knowledge of the film, it came off as a tremendous sciencefiction SUSPENSE THRILLER. There were several scenes that just had me climbing the walls with tension. Fabulous job!And Im not the only one who thinks so. When my WIFE says she wants to see a SCIENCE FICTION movie for the SECOND TIME... well, I dont think THAT has EVER happened before!",True
"Spaceys performance seals the deal This film just premiered a few hours ago at the film festival here in Toronto. Kevin Spacey, Bob Hoskins and Kate Bosworth were in attendance. It was a gala event. Having said that I was very nervous about the success of a film where one guy not only produces, stars in, directs, cowrites but also does his own singing. Well, the guy pulled it off beautifully. The structure takes a little getting used to. It opens with Spacey playing Darin starring in a biopic of his own life. When a reporter walks up to him and says: Dont you think you are a little old to be playing a guy in his twenties? I started to feel relieved. Spacey obviously was aware that this was a potential problem in the way viewers might view his starring role and he chose to deal with it straight on instead of avoiding it. The plot is not important in this film. Rather, what the movie is about is capturing the energy and drive of Darin himself and, perhaps most important, the urgency with which he lived his life. Darin knew from a very young age that his life would likely be cut short due to a heart condition. And that simply drove him to do the best he could, and to do it as quickly as possible. Spaceys singing talent is a wonder to behold. Without actually imitating Darin, he manages to capture Darins charisma and stage presence and well as his singing characteristics and mannerisms. While I never forgot that it was Spacey I was watching, I found his performance to be entirely believable. It was obvious that Spacey, the actor, thoroughly loved what he was doing and that every ounce of his being and all of his energy had been invested into this role. This man is a multitalented individual who tackled a very difficult project and somehow managed to pull it off  beautifully. Highly recommended!",True
"politics with shocks and twists Ryan Goslings at his best in dramatic roles and theres no exception here.

Ides of March has very few flaws, the twists in the plot are not predictable and overall doesnt have any problems connecting with the viewers.

"Surreal but a bit dull.This film aims for shock value rather than plot.We see several generations of a family who are all strange in different ways.The ideas are certainly original and the film moves at a good pace. There are a few twists as we follow the characters and get a view of their quite brutal and unpleasant lifestyles.The reliance on disgust is boring though, if you arent shocked by the imagery then you arent left with much else.The dialogue is minimal and the characters arent likable, we are supposed to see them as exhibits not develop empathy for them. This leaves the film feeling slightly dead with no emotion and no real impact.Watchable for the weirdness but would certainly offer nothing worth a second viewing.",False
"If youre a Boyle fan lower your expectations a little.James Mcavoy is back on form after the dismal Welcome To The Punch. He is Simon who works for a fine art auction house, where one of his duties is to whisk away to a deep vault the most valuable artwork in the event of any attempted robbery. Of course their is a robbery, masterminded by Franck played by Vincent Cassels, the only problem is he has stolen a picture frame but no canvas. Simon is hit on the head during the robbery causing amnesia and cannot remember what happened to the canvas. Franck isnt too chuffed about this so employs Elizabeth  Rosario Dawson a hypnotist to delve into Simons mind to find where he may have secreted the artwork. For at least the first half I was gripped by the plot and characters plus Boyles camera work is spot on as always. I did however feel completely puzzled at one point when the plot seemed to zigzag a bit too much and I began to wonder whether I had lost concentration. I wasnt being dim however because at this point one of the characters explains (in flashback) whats going on. Although an adequate enough watch this was for me a below par Boyle movie. But I suppose with a back catalogue including two of my top ten films he can be excused for not hitting a coconut every time. Overall I was not disappointed to have caught the bus to view this and neither should you be. If you are a Boyle fan just lower your expectations a little.",True
"Lewd, crude, tasteless  and incredibly fun.In a world overrun by forgettable, banal reality television, Jackass has distinguished itself as a franchise with unexpected staying power. Who would have thought that a television show about pulling pranks on unsuspecting members of the public would go on to dominate the silver screen as well? Thats precisely what Johnny Knoxville and his compatriots have done, however. Bad Grandpa marks the Jackass crews fourth foray into the realm of feature films. The movie is itself more ambitious than its predecessors, betting that one character  an apparently doddering 86yearold man  can carry an actual plot and an enormous arsenal of pranks. Surprisingly, its a gamble that pays off: Bad Grandpa is frequently as funny as it is in bad taste.The ostensible plot of it all goes something like this: Irving Zisman (Knoxville) is saddled with his grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) when his flaky daughter is sent to prison and his wife Ellie (Catherine Keener  yes, really!) passes away. Resolving to palm his grandson off to his neerdowell soninlaw, Irving embarks on a road trip across America  an adventure that takes them from strip club to diner, from funeral to beauty pageant, and everything in between. Along the way, they meet people from all walks of life: most of them unsuspecting, several of them kind, all of them pretty good sports.Much of the thrill of watching Bad Grandpa comes from knowing that it is a hiddencamera comedy  one that draws its greatest laughs and amusement from people who have no clue that Irving isnt actually a senior citizen. Many of the pranks border on the tasteless (Irving gets a crucial body part caught in a vending machine, grandpa and grandson engage in a flatulence contest in a diner with disastrous results), but the horrified looks on the faces of innocent passersby make it all work. There are even some moments of inspired comic genius: chiefly, the setpieces that take place in a strip club and at a beauty pageant. (To spoil you any further, dear reader, would be criminal.) It takes a pair of seasoned performers not to crack and give the game away. Knoxville, of course, has years of experience and bodily injury under his belt, and he is astonishingly good at playing a bawdy old man with very few social (and some might say moral) filters. The great surprise is Nicoll, a child with the most perfectly deadpan of faces  hes hilariously convincing whether hes asking a complete stranger to adopt him or reenacting a scenario reminiscent of Abigail Breslins wildly inappropriate grindbump dance in Little Miss Sunshine.This is  evidently  very far from great cinema, even though director Jeff Tremaine does actually manage to sneak a little more sentiment and plot into the film than you might expect. But great cinema does not always equate into a fun, brainless night out at the cinema  which Bad Grandpa, if you set your expectations as low as they can go, will almost indubitably provide you.",False

"Almost Bob Fosse The musical numbers reminded me of Sweet Charity and the camera moves around the Kit Kat Klub style room like Fosses camera did in Cabaret The similarities stop there.

Some of the lines were received with loud guffaws and there is no way to know if that was the intention because, personally, I felt like cringing. Never mind. It was fun. Christina has a powerful voice but not film presence and Cher is a fearless icon but she had so little to show for it. The best performance is, without question, by Stanley Tucci. The songs work at the moment youre watching them being performed but I couldnt hum a tune now, 48 hours later, for the life of me.

"Visceral and intelligent  Bessons masterpiece Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience  Its not realism, its not naturalism  its heightened reality as Gary Oldman very well put it.
In The making of The Professional Besson says If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think Its in me, Im a beast! On this part we cant forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments. He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion  in the movie  the blood running from Mathildas nose or Stansfields unforgettable EVERYONE! are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion  you can hear Fatmans heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathildas father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairytale, but dont be fooled   just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we dont see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in real life? I dont know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course theres the sensuality. Its hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. Its not sick and its not degrading: its art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. Its a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And dont be  Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",False
"The Beach WILL NOT DIE TODAY The Beach is interesting in that some people feel that its terrible while there are others who feel that it is an unsung hero of a movie. When I first saw The Beach, back in 2000, I thought it was OK, not as bad as most people said it was. But, just like with A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach grew on me and I had to watch it again. After seeing it a few more times I really started to pick up on what was going on and realized that at the end of the film the viewer has gone through quite an adventure with Dicaprio and co. The acting, cinematography, music, and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings. The Beach is one of those movies that I watch once a year as its enjoyability never decreases. This is a very solid film that will no doubt only increase in its popularity as time goes by as fans of The Beach are quite hardcore. Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that hes made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters. Because of these reasons The Beach will not die today.",True
"Enemy proves Villeneuves versatility by telling a mindboggling mystery with stunning twists and turns.With last years successful thriller Prisoners, Canadian director Denis Villeneuve made a name for himself among American moviegoers. A year later, with the release of Enemy, the impact Villeneuve has left doesnt seem to be anything that will die down any time soon. Reteaming with his Prisoners star Jake Gyllenhaal, Enemy proves Villeneuves versatility by telling a mindboggling mystery with stunning twists and turns, deep hidden meanings, and a tremendous double performance by Gyllenhaal.Adam Bell is a disheveled, runofthemill everyman living in Toronto, Canada, where he works as a college history professor. When hes not teaching at the university, hes sitting around his highrise apartment in a bored manner or making love with his girlfriend, Mary. Life for Adam is, for a lack of a better word, boring.Things change when a colleague recommends a movie to Adam. Not a fan of watching movies, Adam very reluctantly agrees to rent the film from a local video store. Initially unimpressed with the movie, Adam notices something odd within the movie: one of the actors, by the name of Anthony St. Claire, looks like him. Identical to him, even. This strange discovery fuels an obsession within Adam. An obsession that faces him with situations he would have never expected.Adapted from Jose Saramagos The Double, Javier Gullons screenplay leaves the true meaning behind these events up to the viewer. Although there are very subtle hints to the general idea of the story, there is no clear cut answer to the many twists and turns faced within the films 90 minute run time. What may be a story of totalitarian beliefs to one viewer, as referenced in Adams lecture in the beginning of the film, may be a story of marriage in the modern era. Its amazing how screenplays like these can have such a wide range of themes without any of them being wrong.Despite a talented cast including Melanie Laurent, Sarah Gadon, and Isabella Rossillini, its Jake Gyllenhaal who steals the show. Gyllenhaal delicately balances the introverted, resentful nature of Adam with the loud, imposing personality of Anthony. Its even more impressive that this performance stands as one of Gyllenhaals finest in his long list of great roles. Gadon gives a surprisingly great performance, managing to say a lot with just a long glance at Gyllenhaal. Laurent and Rossillini have smaller roles, but are important assets to the story nonetheless.Enemy has the eerie atmosphere and the thrilling plot that Prisoners had, but thats really their only similarities. Whereas Prisoners was grounded in reality, Enemy is more dreamlike, more surreal. This all comes through Villeneuves delightful directing style, featuring some truly frightening imagery that will strike a nerve with its viewers. However, the hypnotic nature of the film never takes away from its storytelling, which is woefully important for a film that relies this much on its storyline.Enemy isnt for everybody, but its target demographic is sure to find the film to be spellbinding and hypnotic. Villeneuves devious directing is sure to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat the whole time, up until the chilling final frame before the film cuts to the credits. Gyllenhaal holds up the entire film with his bravado double performance, as well as the fantastic supporting cast. With all this together, Enemy has proved to be one of 2014s earliest successes, and it is going to prove to be a tough one to beat.",True

"Sad Eyes (Say Too Little)Tim Burtons Big Eyes is a bad film about bad painters making bad art. Its as dreadful as the artwork on view. The film declaims the true  life story of Margaret Keane, but just how true is true? It purports to tell the story of the artist whose paintings of miserable urchins became the rage back in the sixties. Sadly, just like the unhappy waifs in the paintings, Big Eyes is a sad incomprehensible wreck of a film. (As a teenager, I do remember seeing these prints at a nearby Woolworth and thinking, Who would want these paintings anyway?) Apparently, everyone did, including Natalie Wood, Jerry Lewis and Joan Crawford. That part may be quite true, but some other facts are pure artistic license.The film tries to spin the fad into international glory, overexaggerating the importance of this works of art and the business of marketing art to the masses ala Warhol. There could be an interesting enough backstory about Ms. Keanes life and her sudden wealth, but the mixedup screenplay by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski never does her life any justice as it wavers between farce and drama. The essence of this based on a true story shows the artist too easily giving into her incorrigible manager/husband who claimed to be the sole creator of her schlock art. Ms. Keanes reasons for the anonymity are never fully explained. The script hints at her low selfesteem issues and the societal backlash against female artists at the time, although the latter argument is weak, with other artists like O Keefe, Frankenthaler, and Krasner achieving fame and fortune back then. The film tends to skim over the more relevant facts of her life.Burton does succeed, at least, visually with the look of the film from Colleen Atwoods costumes and production design by Rich Heinrich which captures the period details handsomely. However, characterwise, the film is a muddle with the tone of the film caroming from cheeky melodrama to absurd comedy, as in a scene involving a harsh (but accurate) critic and a courtroom scene that is too absurd to be believed. Amy Adams does invest some depth into her illdefined character, but Christoph Waltz is far too slick and charmless as her duplicitous and scheming spouse. Big Eyes is a big bad disappointment.

Instead, we get treated to a bipolar movie that is, at times, really funny, but mostly full of unnecessary exposition. I think Burton wanted to honor the TV show by adding in so many details, but frankly, it was boring at times as they moved from one plot point to another. Some of the wrap up surprises at the end came off as forced.

"Its a platinum lining, not just silver.Im remaking myself. Pat (Bradley Cooper)Silver Linings Playbook doesnt play by the current romantic comedy book—No scatology, nudity, fbombing, or feminist and gay bashing. Its simply a smart playbook about the mental institutions recentlyreleased Pat Solitano (Cooper, shedding his Hangover boyman shtick), who may be saner than his dad, an OCD gambler (Robert De Niro), and Bradleys new friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence).But that comparison is all relative because director David O. Russell (remember his funky family in Flirting with Disaster?) allows each character in this dramedy to become whole and interesting without becoming marginalized. After some serious outbursts of anger, Pat starts training for a dance competition with Tiffany in order to make contact with and eventually impress his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee).The eventualities of the story are not half as stimulating as the plot along the way, some of the best scenes centered around the family squabbling about the Philadelphia Eagles or Pats relationship with that slut, Tiffany. When Pat confronts his parents at 4 AM about the deficiency of Hemingways ending to A Farewell to Arms and when Russell places under another scene Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash singing Girl from the North Country, you know youre in a film that follows no particular playbook.The dynamics as fostered by these superior actors are some of the best ensemble work this year. In fact, this is so far the best of the romantic comedies in recent memory. Pat and Tiffany may be bipolar, but they can dance the stars into your eyes. Jennifer Lawrence plays so different a character from those in Winters Bone and Hunger Games that it may take you a scene or two to recognize her. But when she dances, youll confirm shes one of the best young actresses in Hollywood, and this film one of the best of the year.",False
"Playful, Surprising and Ambitious, Its Not Your Typical Romantic Comedy A foreheadwrinkling bit of relationship fantasy thatll stick in your teeth for days. I found a lot of thematic similarities between this one and Being John Malkovich. Though its not nearly so dark and grim about it, The One I Love delights in asking similarly deep, puzzling questions about the root of an unhappy relationship and the sense of futility thats so often associated with mending something so broken. Of course, like Malkovich, its also based around a weird, jolting plot device that skirts explanation for its own benefit. The real allure of that vehicle, of course, isnt with the solemn inspection of its construct, its with the games it directs with the main players. Usually Im the first to complain when such an elephant is left ignored in the back of the room, but in this case (if youll excuse the string of metaphors) I think it would be a case of missing the forest for the trees. Its not perfect  the falsefinish is telegraphed and the second act sags at times  but it deserves praise for trying something so fresh, and for evenly exploring both sides of the central relationship.

"I feel like everybody has missed the point I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldnt help reading several for this film on this site that just didt seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was too depressing for a childrens film, but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isnt all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nannystate we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what cant be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.",False
"This little girl can look after herself just fine, thank you.Rynn Jacobs is a lonely, but well equipped 13year old girl who lives with her poet father, while keeping a dark secret in the cellar. Although whenever somebody dropped by she would tell him or her that her father was too busy to greet his or her guests, or that he was out of town. But her life in solitaire is interrupted when she gets a visit from her snoopy landlady and her perverted son who takes a real shinning to Rynn. This is when Rynn goes to any lengths to keep this lifestyle with the help from a local crippled boy Mario, to herself.This noteworthy gem of smallscale, mysterythriller incorporates a fascinating slowdrifting character study that has certain believability in its characterizations and manipulative suspense. The macabrely, lurid context of the film could have overstep the mark, but it keeps it mostly underwrapped with it being more hinted, than aiming for anything really illustrative. But that in mind, it doesnt lose any of that unnerving effect thats spun out, because the confronting performances and crafty dialogues are extremely effective in underlining the disquieting horror that lurks within the films makeup. What sweeps you along is that the script is lyrically dense and quite thoughtful, while it still generates psychological tension in certain scenes without needing to go out with a bang. Theres nothing big or powerful about it, because it plays it cards close to its chest and grafts away with its involving story and sedated handling. The compelling plot is incredibly well defined by touching on many different aspects that Fosters character encounters. These range from loneliness to her approach on life through an adult perspective and finally that of her estrange relationships with some of the towns folk. Its all about her finding her feet and living her life the way she wants to without the intrusion of others (the adults) enforcing their resolutions onto her because shes just a child. Life is what you make it and shes not going to play their game. Its just really hard to categorise this unique film (which, was originally intended to be a TV movie), because it goes down oh so many paths, but its successful in gelling them together.Jodie Foster in the lead role makes the character her own by providing a maturely astute performance as the independent girl Rynn Jacobs. Her professionalism really does take hold in this picture and she does so with great control. Martin Sheen is equally as good and believable by playing his villainous character in a very subtle way, but still able to bring a creepy and vile presence to this predator Frank. Scott Jacoby is likable as Mario; Alexis Smith is great as the intrusively stern landlady Mrs. Hallet and Mort Shuman as the caring local officer gives a moving performance. What makes these performances so great is that they have vivid characters to feed off and shape.Since it was intended to be a TV movie it does feel and look like one, but none of that took away from the elegant looking production. You could tell it was lowkey because most of the film did take place in or around Rynns isolated house. The direction by Nicolas Gessner is carefully crafted and from the outset he paints a mysteriously brooding atmosphere. The simple layout of photography is crisp and beautifully demonstrated. While, the stirring score is quite a strange one with its heavy handed approach, but it has some sort of a hypnotic trance because it likes to play around with the moody and quite edgy situations.This underappreciated find of the 70s is a surprisingly focused and innovative treat that grips you from the very opening.",True
"Elvis gets a badge Greetings again from the darkness. The tagline nails the tone of the film: On August 21, 1970 two of Americas greatest recording artists met for the first time. Director Liza Johnson proceeds to tell the story of worlds colliding – an Oval Office meeting with President Richard Nixon and Elvis Presley. Of course, this is a fictionalized and satirical accounting, since Nixon didnt kickoff his recording passion until the following year.It would be pretty easy to bash the film as heavy on cheese and light on historical accuracy, but that would be missing the point. These two public figures couldnt have been much different from each other, but the script (Joey and Hanala Sagal, and Cary Elwes) finds a way to have these two icons hold a conversation  bonding over their mutual hatred of The Beatles.The terrific opening credit sequence perfectly captures the time period and is a work of art unto itself. We first see Elvis shooting out the picture tubes in the TV room at Graceland. Hes disgusted with the news reports of Woodstock and drug use among Americas youth. Constructing a loose plot to meet with President Nixon and offer his service as a Federal Agentatlarge, Elvis is mostly interested in adding a federal badge to his collection.Michael Shannon plays Elvis and Kevin Spacey takes on the Nixon role. Rather than a finely tuned impersonation, Shannon goes after more of an impression or reimagining of The King. Its a perfect fit for this setting, and there is nothing like watching Shannon give an impromptu karate demonstration for the leader of the free world in the most famous room in America. Spacey, on the other hand, is spot on in capturing the posture, mannerisms, sound and essence of a man who carried much personal baggage with his political power.The chain of events leading up to the meeting plays a bit like a farcical comedy. Nixons staff of Bud Krough (Colin Hanks), Dwight Chapin (Evan Peters) and HR Haldeman (Tate Donovan) is equal parts incredulous and opportunistic. We get two members of Elvis Memphis Maphia with Alex Pettyfer playing Jerry Schilling and Johnny Knoxville adding even more humor as Sonny West. There is a nice blend of little comedy moments and outright laughers – Elvis impersonators confronting him in an airport, the Secret Service reaction to Elvis gift to Nixon of collectible WWII pistols, and Elvis meeting with a DEA official played by Tracy Letts.I found myself smiling throughout, with full understanding that this satirical look at a meeting between two famous men with little common ground has no real historical importance  other than resulting in the alltime most requested photograph from the National Archives. But for 86 minutes of smiling, I say to the filmmakers and actors  Thank you. Thank you very much.",False
"Indie Film Perfection Just saw this at the Ritz East. There wasnt much else playing & this had an 8.1 rating on IM Db so I thought Id check it out. My instincts were well rewarded because this was one of the best movies Ive seen. It was a very well constructed film detailing the relationship of the Romantic poet John Keats with his lover Fanny Brawne, as well as Keats relationship with his friend and patron Charles Brown.The actors were relatively unknown to me. Im pretty sure Ive seen Paul Schneider, who played Charles Brown, in other films. But Abbie Cornish, who played Fanny, and Ben Whishaw, who played Keats, are new to me. They were great. I cant imagine anyone doing a better job.Jane Campion, the Director, brought the period to life. And the character development was outstanding. The viewer really felt a connection to the characters in the film, even minor characters, like Fannys mother & siblings, were highly engaging. Fannys younger sister was the most adorable little girl in film since Gretl in The Sound of Music.The music and mood of the movie fit the period and subject perfectly. I was mesmerized from the beginning to the end of this great film. I think Ill go back and see it again. It was that good.The movie ended, while the credits rolled, with Whishaw reciting Ode to a Nightingale set to classical music. The audience stayed up until the last credit rolled. It was a nice touch to finish the movie with.This movie will likely be the definitive film about Romantic poets. Maybe Campion will direct a movie about Byron in Greece or Shelley in Italy. One thing is for sure, she set the bar pretty high with Bright Star.",False
"Top Notch Pulp....True Romance is a celebration of film.  It wallows in every possible seedy contrivance of American crime/action cinema.  It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence, overacting, melodrama, lurid sex, and rampant drug use...I love it.  Quentin Tarantino, as Im sure everyone knows, wrote the story, but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast, oh the cast:  The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  They both give solid performances, which prevents the film from flying off the tracks; they serve as the pilot light.  The supporting roles are the gas.  The Walken/Hopper show down has been oft sighted as the films best aspect, and this is, arguably, true.  Just watch this scene and then watch it again.  Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders.  OK, youve got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis, Brad Pitt as a disgruntled potsmoking loser, Tom Sizemore & Chris Penn as cops, James Gandolfini (pre Sopranos) as a reflective hitman, and youve even got Bronson Pinchot (from T Vs PERFECT STRANGERS) for Gods sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project (theyre not all good films, but...).  Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why?  He has got to be the best actor working today, hands down.  As Drexel Spivey, Oldman chews the scenery, digests it, and then expels it from every orifice.  Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant overthetop insanity. Tony Scott, who along with his brother Ridley, has been known to overdirect a film or two, here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run.  The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made, ballstothewall, popcorn throwing, cult classic.  In a market dominated with stereotypical characters, this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 9/10",True
"Wanted to Like It So Much More I am a huge Coen Brothers Fan. Many of their films are hard core 10s in my ratings and I had an uneasy feeling going into this one. The trailer made me think of Intolerable Cruelty more than O Brother Where Art Thou or many of their other films.It felt like a strung together series of little set pieces that didnt hang together as a whole. I wont mention the plot since there was virtually none and what there was was fairly flat and unimportant.Normally the Brothers can overcome a weak plot (although strong plotlines have driven several of their movies) with strong quirky performances and memorable cinematography.Sadly, the dialog lacked snap, the film didnt pop off the screen looks wise, given that its a period piece, and with such a strong cast, everyone looked tired  almost as if they had come in to film their parts after getting off their day jobs and they were just doing a favor to the Coens.Overall Ive seen much worse but when you go to a Coen Brothers film, you just expect much more.",False
"somethings going on in the bedroom9 out of 10Watching Todd Fields feature film debut `In the Bedroom, I could not help but be impressed by the sheer audacity of the film, by the spoton performances, and by the many twists and turns that no critic should reveal. Yet amidst all the films obvious strengths, there was still something missingsomething to tie it all together, something to endow the film with more than just a fleeting impression.Ironically perhaps, I was provided this missing bit of information not by the film, but by a male audience member sitting at the end of my aisle, trying to explain the point of the film in less than derogatory terms to his female companion.`Youre missing the whole point of the film, he said.  `It was all about men being controlled by women.No doubt he read this interpretation from someone elses review of the film (and what a sweet piece of justice it would be if that critic were a woman). It is quite possible that he was not even aware of the ramifications of what he had said.  But this mans legitimacy aside, his statement has not left me since, and the film in turn has had the same luck in escaping me.We are first introduced to Frank Fowler (Nick Stahl, `Bully) and Natalie Strout (Marisa Tomei, `My Cousin Vinny), he a young college student with no immediate plans to settle down, she an older divorcee raising two children. They are in love, though for Frank she is little more than a `summer fling. Meanwhile Natalies exhusband, Richard (William Mapother, `Mission: Impossible 2), is unwilling to let her out of his life, and begins to be physically abusive to Frank. Franks parents, Matt (Tom Wilkinson, `The Full Monty) and Ruth (Sissy Spacek, `The Straight Story)both in top form hereshow appropriate concern for their only son, and they intervene in this dangerous love triangle with unexpected twists and tragic results.The film jumps about in tone from a light romantic romp to a seeming political treatise to a creepy, nocturnal thriller.  Some have criticized the film for this alleged inconsistency in tone, slow pacing, and a deliberate ending.  But these naysayers have overlooked the point.Frank may not even really love Natalie, so much as he loves being controlled by her and sating his mother by being with her.  Richard becomes a threat to everyone because he is unwilling to let Natalie consider him out of her life; he is a slave to her whim.  The resulting tension reveals a rift between Franks parents, and in particular, his fathers actions in the end demonstrate a helpless allegiance to his wife and her command.Field, who up until now has been primarily an actor (he was the piano player in `Eyes Wide Shut), understands these important points but does not beat the viewer over the head with them.  He presents a reality more raw and true than any other piece of film in recent memory.  Yet he does so with a restraint that Hollywood seems to have forgotten.  Most of the films violence is overheard or implied, and only explicitly shown when necessary for the audience to completely understand what has happened.  This allows for more subtle details, like a bridgekeeper who must run around in circles to alternate traffic between the road and the sea, to emerge as truly haunting, lasting images.But `In the Bedroom is not about any of these things.  It is, first and foremost, about its characters.  It does not fall prey to plot mechanics, nor does it flinch at exploring even the most sympathetic characters darkest sides.  For this and so many other reasons which are best left discussed behind closed doors between loved ones, `In the Bedroom succeeds at turning the camera on flawed relationships of all forms, and it is one of the best films of the year.",False
"Surprising Film I was given free advanced screening tickets to see this film, and being the film buff that I am, I took them and went and saw it. I had seen a trailer before hand and knew what to expect from the film, but I gotta be honest, my expectations were low and the only reason I watched it is cause they were free tickets.Now, after seeing it, I can tell you the film was an awesome surprise. The cast was great, the action fun, and the plot unique. I didnt see any of the twists coming and I found the film to be very entertaining. It doesnt get too convoluted at any point and is a great chase/illusion film. Its like a funner version of The Prestige, not that the two belong in the same class, just an easy way to quickly summarize what the movie is trying to accomplish (although Michael Caine is in both films!)Go see it, as will I, again. A fun summer movie that is likely to surprise more than a few people with its plot and twists!",False
"Very Well Done Revenge is hardly a fresh concept in filmmaking. This basic theme, however, here takes a backseat to the styled execution of Out of the Furnace. Told through an allstar cast, the story unfolds slowly, but powerfully. Set in a rural, presentday America, the cinematography captures a beautiful country and glory that is seemingly fading under the weight of war and the economy. The cast skillfully fleshes out the various characters, establishing believability and giving them a rare level of depth. This makes the atmosphere tangible and arguably makes the element of human drama the actual star of the film. The entire cast is excellent and essential, however Christian Bale and Woody Harrelson absolutely steal the show. As the badtothebone villain of the script, Harrelson is awesomely despicable, his mere presence on the screen inciting anxiety. Alternately, Bale plays a good but troubled man, condemned to watch his life disintegrate one piece at a time. I caught the director, Scott Cooper, in an interview segment on Carson Daly. He mentioned a desire to impact and immerse the audience in his movies. In that regard, I would judge this effort to be an undeniable success. During certain scenes, I found myself echoing the actions and emotions depicted on screen, such as dread, liberation, uneasiness, tension, and particularly, a relieved breath of serenity. More drama than action, the tone for me was reminiscent of The Place Beyond the Pines, another wellexecuted drama with a definite crime flavoring. Also, I felt that the Pearl Jam number that opens and closes the film was a perfect choice for the intended vibe, and deserves a special mention. Overall, this movie is very well done, despite lacking the glamour and flash of an action flick. As a drama, I highly recommend it to fans of the genre.",False
"More style than substance?At the outset, i should make it clear that i dont think this is a bad film, but i felt the need to add a dissenting voice to the collection of positive reviews that ive read so far.The film is an amalgamation of elements that should work beautifully, but ultimately resembles one of the sterile offerings to be found in Susans gallery. The acting is superb throughout, and the nuanced performances of Amy Adams & Jake Gyllenhaal are worthy of their reputations. The subtle transitions from dead and lifeless to young and vibrant, exhibited by the former at various stages of the film, is one of the most striking features of the piece. The film is beautifully shot and well directed, and there are some truly moving scenes in parts. However, as one reviewer has already alluded to, the film feels like it is desperate to say something, but ultimately says very little. Perhaps i just didnt get it at all.The problem i had was with a lack of emotional connection to either of the main protagonists. Its interesting to find out what happens to both as the film builds, but ultimately i didnt care either way.My partner and i spent some time examining the film on the way home, discussing the parallels between the story at the heart of the film, and the realities that continue around it, but despite our rudimentary analysis of what each one meant for the other, and an understanding that there are some clever parallels, what remained was the underlying sense of so what?.",True
"Lands successfully between crime thriller, gangster saga and character study*REVIEW OF BOTH PARTS* There is a short paragraph that opens both Mesrine films; the exact wording escapes me, but it says something like no film can accurately portray the complexities of a human life. This seems to be a preemptive defense, as if Richet anticipates criticism for a lack of depth or some glaring omissions. After all, Jacques Mesrine is apparently still a famous name in France, and his public persona lives on. If even half his supposed exploits were true, the story would still be crying out for a definitive dramatisation. As such, Richet has wisely avoided making any real ethical judgements of Mesrines character, focusing instead on the sex, violence and publicity that he thrived upon. But its Vincent Cassels committed and exuberant performance that develops this meatandpotatoes content into an unbiased character study of excess and, over all, a very fine pair of movies.Mesrine may not seem to be particularly evenhanded at first because of the glamour, the wisecracks, and the endless charisma, all of which are drawn from the rich stylistic tradition of the Gangster Movie, and used very skilfully in its favour. The fast pace of the story ensures we are either seduced or repulsed by the central character, and rarely anywhere in between. Sympathy or pity is irrelevant, and he is too brutal and triggerhappy to be rooted for as a regular protagonist. The first film is the slicker of the two, and the more visually satisfying due to the wonderfully stylish recreation of early 60s Paris (and elsewhere). Cassel plays Mesrine with youthful vigour here. Hes all style and brash confidence, as endearing a wiseguy as any of Scorceses characters. Its Goodfellas, in fact, that Killer Instinct is most reminiscent of, with its sharpsuited mobsters (including a brilliantly grizzled Gerard Depardieu) and episodic yearhopping narrative.By the halfway point, Mesrine is still something of an enigma. Its only in Public Enemy No. 1 that the pace slows down and we can see, through a few intimate and contemplative scenes, what he has sacrificed to live as a superlative criminal. I wasnt much of a son, Im not much of a father either. he says, while in disguise visiting his own ailing father in hospital. He gradually alienates his closest friends and accomplices by trying to maintain the outlandish public profile he cultivated, rambling pseudorevolutionary politics to journalists and threatening to kill judges and destroy all maximum security prisons. The Goodfellas ensemble of the first part becomes the isolated, egodriven Scarface of the second as Cassel skilfully matures his character into a man resigned to the fate he knows must be coming.The over all impression left by Mesrine is that it manages to land successfully between crime thriller, gangster saga and character study. This is achieved by the virtue of a standout central performance, as well as Richets shrewd application of an American filmmaking style to a very French story. It ought to go down among the top crime dramas of the decade, or at the very least raise the (already decent) international profile of its impressive leading man.",False
"Envy is a funny thing www.Ramascreen.com FOOTNOTE is an Israeli film thats Oscarnominated this year for Foreign language category and I can see why it received the nod. Its quite possibly one of the funniest rivalry stories Ive ever watched, and what makes the dilemma even more complicated is that its between father and son. I think its a wellmade film, its funny, it has its charms, youll enjoy writer/director Joseph Cedars way of telling you the backstories of each character, some of the scenes interestingly move like microform reel, those of us who didnt grow up knowing anything about Talmud or Jewish culture would get a slight education on one of some of the things they regard highly over there, but halfway through the film, it loses its attraction, it doesnt engage you enough, and ultimately it ends itself in somewhat of a tactless mannerEliezer is the father and Uriel is the son and they both share the same last name, and thats where the misunderstanding plays its card. Both individuals dabble in the same literature but the father is oldschool and stubborn and even though the film doesnt come out and say it, he may also suffer from some kind of autism or something that keeps him from desiring any social contact unless its meant to celebrate him, or perhaps hes just introverted to the extreme. The son is more progressive, people are fond of him, and he enjoys the success that his father has always wishes he had. So when a certain prestigious award mistakes one for the other, Uriel is faced with the dilemma of what is the right thing to do. After he makes his decision, his father goes off and discredits his sons work. Its a pretty sad and tough family dynamics, if you think about it, because on the fathers case, its envy that turns into bitterness that turns into gloat, on the sons side its wanting to live up to his father that turns into generosity that turns into feelings betrayed. Writer/director Cedar designs it so that things would escalate to the point where there is no other option but to openly confront each other, although oddly enough, the film never gives us that luxury.The comedy aspect of it is very enjoyable, Cedar takes us through awkward room sizes and youll get the giggles from watching Elizer putting on his giant headset, shutting everything around him down just to get some silence, and for the old professors roles, Cedar casts actors who look just like the stereotype, they look unintentionally amusing. Embedded in the competition is also a the theme of whether or not you are your fathers son or if you are your own person. Uriel seems distraught and offended when his own son doesnt make any effort to win his love, like he used to do with his own father. Both Eliezer and Uriel are obsessed with the idea that success can only be found in ones achievements and accomplishments and the recognition from your peers, and how one can be better at that than everybody else, so much so that theyre missing out one whats truly important, each other. I think FOOTNOTE is a very unique family dynamics film that deserves attention at the very least. www.Ramascreen.com ",False
"Razorsharp & hilarious Saw this great little comedy of manners, cleverly disguised as a thriller/whodunnit. The first image of the coldly distant, observing cat puts the spectator in the right frame of mind. A very clever script that makes every scene count, peak and slice away. A brilliant miseenscene that refuses to heighten the emotions or prettify. Isabelle Huppert absolutely shines, balancing all the minute emotional ticks in every scene, perfectly in control. She leads an ensemble of actors that play the diverse characters/antagonists to perfection. The story is actually all subtext, the main plot only used to connect all the dots and leading us by the nose to the bigger picture. The movie is marvelously playful, refusing to be dramatic, cute or opt for an easy way out. At the same time everything is done with great style and measured, cooked to perfection. Curiously i felt like i was about the only person in the audience who was chuckling along with every scene, maybe my dark sense of humor or feeling the unmistakably Verhoeven tone more acute with every movie of this great director i get to see. What else  a great score by Anne Dudley and Said Ben Said is getting to be my favorite producer !!! And now quite curious to read the source novel.",True
"An Unusual, Surreal Tale About Something On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) encounters a strange Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer) who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world.Okay, we have an amazing cast here: Lance Henriksen, Billy Bob Thorton, Crispin Glover, Iggy Pop, and Robert Mitchums final role. That automatically counts for something. And we have the whole thing shot in glorious black and white, which is all too uncommon since the 1960s. That is another point.Now, on the other hand, commercially, the movie lost a boatload of money (making only about 10% of what it cost) and ranks as the most expensive of Jarmuschs films.And critically, it has mixed reviews. Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film, giving it less than two stars and saying, Jim Jarmusch is trying to get at something here, and I dont have a clue what it is. He calls it a strange, slow, unrewarding movie and says the score sounds like nothing so much as a man repeatedly dropping his guitar. Others, such as Jonathan Rosenbaum and A. O. Scott, have called it one of the best films of the 1990s.I happened to like it, though I did not fully appreciate the William Blake references (as well as Tom Petty references). But that is my loss, not Jarmuschs fault. And I am not sure I got the message, if there is one. And I still like Broken Flowers better... but there is still much to love here.",True
"Good but dark A young man is released from prison after being incarcerated since he was a child. His attempts to adjust to the outside world arent always successful.This isnt a feel good movie about a struggle for redemption or the effects of rehabilitation. This is a dark, gritty and realistic view of how things could be for a person newly released after a horrible crime.There isnt a lot of graphic bloodshed; most of that is implied instead of being played for shock value. Thats good; this movie doesnt need any more shock value than is already portrayed. You arent particularly encouraged to sympathize with the excon, nor are you encouraged to condemn him. Instead the film makes you an objective observer to his trials and tribulations, his attempts to get into society with as little trouble as possible, the reactions of people who know and work with him.",False

Directed by Michael Bay. Running time: 135 minutes. Rated R (for strong intense violence, language and brief sexuality)Notes taken while screening The Rock:· The film contains superior character development of both the antagonist and protagonist. Each is clear and well defined. We also learn the characters motives, reasoning, dramatic situation, and premiseall brilliantly introduced within the setup.· Sean Connery provides us with strong character development through John Patrick Masonalthough the character is somewhat a rip off of the Anthony Hokins Hannibal from The Silence of the Lambs.· It is uncanny how well the movies visual style works. It propels the films suspense the extra mile, increasing the tension and enticement. Also contributing to the style is the fitting soundtrack.· Some of the events are excessively coincidental. For example, during an exciting chase scene, Mason dashes out of a building, escaping the clutches of concealing police, discovering a Hum V seemingly awaiting his arrival. Experienced chemist, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), chases after him, in a high speed Ferrari  sitting outside his position in a building. Another coincidence occurs in the high security prison, where Mason escapes a grenade blast by dashing at random into a room, where, of course, there just so happens to be a secure bathtub to climb in. · There is a stolid, aggressively effective cast present. Each actor contributes a taut, penetrating performance, especially Ed Harris as the films villain, General Francis X. Hummel who demands a moral purpose holding the lives of an urban area at stake.* The characters motives and perfectly defined, especially General Francis X. Hummel.  Even as the films bad guy, he serves an understandable position, thus we empathize with him, unlike most villains witnessed in modern day thrillers.· The standard three act structure is flawless: each scene propels the plot forward. The sequences either create a new problem or complicate a previous conflict, favoring with the later concept. This raises the line of tension even further.· Most of the production takes place in a high security prison, Alcatraz, crafted with a complex, aweinspiring atmosphere towering over that of most action movies.· Sean Connery handles the complicated role of John Mason with mere simplicity, yet easily torments the audience with a sense of omniscient knowledge of the plot.· The picture is unpredictable and contains several inducing and unexpected twists proving this movie is imaginative and free to surprise us.

"Famous scenes and symbolism reimagined beautifully but also problematically In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that Ive been turning over in my mind ever since. Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had. I have been frequently convinced that Baz Luhrmann does not know how to read, but I do have the advantage of literacy. However, I am not Nick Carraway and am not compelled to follow his fathers advice that opens Fitzgeralds classic novel The Great Gatsby.The first big problem with this movie version is that Tobey Maguires Nick is not the same Nick that we know and love from the novel. This Nick is a quirky, agitated simpleton who has gone insane and has decided to become a writer. His voice and disposition was all wrong. Nick is no longer our credible vantage point into the selfish, boorish ways of the old money and new money of Daisy, Tom, Jordan and Gatsby in East Egg and West Egg. Much has been said about the lavish style of the films sets and imagery and even more about the ludicrous soundtrack. But it mostly works. I dont think anyone can deny that the unrestrained money, extravagant mansions, brilliant costumes and choreography with a lively score just make the whole story seem more fun. I still have no idea what the point of the 3D was. Nicks bowtie and the strange shooting style (mostly prominent early on) just made everything look cartoonish. At times, it looked like they were driving Gatsbys yellow car through the set of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The cartoon stylings mostly affected Nick; Gatsbys parties are always supposed to be at least slightly surreal.Problems definitely arise in the beginning when Luhrmann chooses to use his typical flash editing and put some party scenes out of order. The randomness of it all and Nick becoming even farther removed from the narrator we once trusted, was only reconfirming that this was in fact the disaster many expected it to be. But then we met Gatsby. And more importantly, we met Daisy. And even more importantly, Gatsby met Daisy. It is literally impossible to live up to the expectations about Gatsby – both the man built on wild whispers of him being a war hero, but also the literary character so ingrained in popular culture that he has earned the adjective great in front of his name. Leonardo Di Caprio does as good a job as anyone could reasonably expect of him. He drew me in, and since Nick couldnt do that, it was even more than I could ask of him.One of the significant themes glowing throughout the novel is that of hope. Luhrmann even recognizes this with Nick referring to Gatsby as the singularly most hopeful man he has ever met. And then we would get a shot of the green light glistening off the water and through the fog from the end of Daisys dock. The one thing missing from Di Caprios interpretation of Gatsby was that earnest hope. I felt like a photographer on a model shoot: Now give me a look of hope! No, thats anger. Give me hope! No, thats sadness. Give me hope! No, thats frustration. Fine, just give me another look of despair.Gatsby yearned for Daisy. And so do we. Carey Mulligans Daisy was probably the most accurate character reimagined from the novel. Starting from her introductory scene where she lay on the couch and the wind rustled her white curtains and her diamond ring sparkled in the daylight and then she turned to stare at Nick, she filled the screen with her ethereal beauty and faux innocence. I dont think its surprising that the film takes its best form in the scenes where its just Gatsby and Daisy.Its hard not to get wrapped up in the grandiosity of Gatsby, the grandiosity of the story, and the grandiosity of the films visuals. Its a beautiful story and it does look beautiful on the big screen, but then comes the nagging suspicion that Luhrmann never actually read the novel. After all, half of the quotes are just paraphrased and are not the actual lines from Fitzgerald, and all of the scenes and famous imagery are only the ones that have seeped into the public consciousness (straight from the Cliffs Notes, perhaps). It should work well as a way to introduce another generation to this accomplished work of art, and I do applaud them for that, but it doesnt serve those who already know the book well.",False
"It Gets Better, but not for everyone Reviewing a documentary like this one becomes as much a review of the actual event as a commentary on the cinematic production. And since thoughts about this actual event are fraught with emotions on either side, or on many sides, the reviews I skimmed through seemed inclined to see this presentation of the events as being biased against whoever the reviewer felt was the real victim.Im gay and personally experienced the bullying & name calling from classmates (and lack of support from any adults who might be expected to provide guidance to young people) while I was in school in suburban Chicago many, many years ago. I would, therefore, be inclined to see Larry as the victim and Brandon as the bad guy, at least before getting into the facts of the case.I think the documentary has done a laudable job showing that both children  and they were 14 and 15 year old children at the time  were victims of both parental & societal neglect, abandonment, abuse and mind boggling stupidity. Both lost their lives from preventable and curable problems. Larry quite literally was denied the opportunity to ever find out if It Gets Better and Brandon doesnt fare a whole lot better although he continues to live.I applaud the emphasis that the documentary puts on the adults involved. It may take a village to raise a child, but the cabal of idiots involved in this case demonstrates the damage a village of adults can cause in the pathetic attempt to raise its children. The homophobic, bitter 7th grade teacher is as bad as the foolish 8th grade teacher who gave Larry a second–hand dress and treated him like a Barbie doll. Equally to blame were the school officials who were more interested in toeing the legal line than serving the interest of their students  including Larry and Brandon before the crisis and all the other children following the event.The parents of the two boys and others who were meant to care for them were, for the most part, sadly inadequate. Apparently the care facility in which Larry ended up was a good place, but otherwise these two kids were left to deal with their own circumstances as well as with the drug addled failings of the adults in their lives, with no help. The prosecuting attorney seemed fairly level headed, although I dont really understand why Brandon was not allowed to be tried as a child. Possibly his outward appearance seemed more adult than his fragile personality would suggest. The defense attorneys seemed reasonable in their desire to have Brandon not tried as an adult, but the woman attorney who, at the end, kept announcing she loved Brandon and started crying, was acting in an irrational, far too emotional manner. Her interest in Brandon seemed anything but professional.Certainly some of the jurors were totally incapable of making a valid judgment. Since there was no question about what Brandon had done, the only decision that needed to be made was what to do with him following the murder. Society had failed to protect him (or Larry) and now some inadequate representatives of that failed society were expected to decide what should happen next. If it werent so sad, it would be funny. Had Brandon been raised in a reasonably normal family situation and developed into a selfassured, confident, loved young man, when Larry approached him while he was playing basketball with friends, Brandon could easily have laughed it off or even hugged Larry and turned it into a joke. But he saw it as one more attack on his personal dignity and from someone far less intimidating than his father. Neither of these two children should have been made to feel so hated, to have developed such selfloathing and to have been abandoned to deal with life on their own. Based on the letter that Brandon sent to the one teacher, maybe incarceration provided some protection for him and allowed him to develop into a more selfassured, sensible individual. It would be easy to argue that incarceration for 21 years was too little or too much. Was it meant to be punishment or as an attempt to provide a remedial environment? It did save him from further abuse from his father (who died soon after the incident anyway) and the selfabsorbed drug addicted mother, but that should have happened before he murdered Larry.I think the documentary was quite well done. I know some people with limited attention spans may have found it slow moving at times, but that may have been appropriate since neither of these marginal children ever generated much in the way of speedy action from the local community and that lethargy & indifference extended even to the collateral damage inflicted on the other children in this story.",False
"This is not nothing I saw this before the brouhaha with Clinton and Lewinsky broke, and I imagine most of the negative comments about this film came because they saw it after and thought this was a Nostradamus film.  When I saw it, I thought it started a bit slow, and was a bit too selfsatisfied (like the scenes of people crying at a concert; that seemed fake).  However, for most of the way, this is sharp, biting, and yes, funny, though when I first saw it, I thought it was more accurate in its Hollywood satire than on its government satire.  Time, of course, proved me wrong.David Mamet will never be universally loved, because not only does there seem to be a large group that doesnt get him, but that thinks those of us that like him are degenerates.  Myself, I happen to think hes one of the best playwrights and screenwriters working today (though Im split so far on his novels).  His writing may be highly stylized, but I guess Im in tune to the rhythms of his dialogue.  And he doesnt assume his audience is dumb; rather, he seeks to challenge them by asking you to come to your own conclusions, rather than hit you over the head.  And he does that very well in this movie; at the beginning, we may think Conrad Brean and Stanley Motss are real sleazebags, but at the end, while we deplore the action they take of faking a war just for political ends, we cant quite dismiss them either.Of course, a lot of that has to do with the performances of Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman (Anne Heche is also a standout as Winnifred Ames, the increasingly bemused presidential aide).  De Niro seems at first like a teddy bear here, with his beard, his hat, and his bow tie, but he transfers the energy associated with his more volatile roles (TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS et al) to guile and street smarts here.  The way his eyes probe whoever hes talking to, and the way he anticipates almost every verbal comeback the other person has demonstrates that(he cant anticipate every event, of course, but once he gets used to it, he can).But the standout here is Hoffman.  Theres been a lot of comment on Hoffman basing his character on Robert Evans.  My own theory is he read Lynda Obsts excellent book HELLO, HE LIED, which talks about the producers role, and simply played that.  I formed that theory because of his mantra whenever things go wrong, This is nothing!, especially when Winnifred reads him the riot act after their plane crashes.  Theres a part in the book where Obst talks about having to argue budget with the studio, and realizes its all a game where they have roles to play; she argues for more money, the studio for less.  Just as Winnifreds role is to be pessimistic, and Stanleys is to be optimistic.  And Hoffman never condescends to Stanley, instead showing a talented, maybe amoral guy who deep down is so insecure that he values credit even over his life(F*** my life, I want the credit! is one of the best lines of the film).  Contrary to his line, this film is not nothing.",False
"Partners In Crime In this modern version of the infamous Leopold and Loeb murder case of the 1920s, Swoon stresses the gay angle, relative to Compulsion (1959), a film of the same story, but burdened by the watchful eye of the censors associated with the moralistic Hays Code. Actual court records do in fact indicate that the relationship or bond between these two guys was primarily sexual.Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb apparently had a masochistic pact. And Swoon asks the question: which guy was in control? The answer seems to be that they alternated control. Also, compared to Compulsion, more attention is given to the actual murder of the teenage boy.This film is quite stylized. Archival images and lyrical cutaways unrelated to the story are used because they are thematically relevant. Further, some scenes are intended as dreams. And nonperiod piece elements add textural perspective.The real Nathan Leopold is shown in historical footage, first as a young man at about the time of the actual killing. He is shown in a sequence with a group of fellow ornithologists. And near the end of the film, he is shown as an older man, having been released from prison.Swoon was shot in B&W. Images are a tad grainy, maybe deliberately so, as part of the films visual style. Casting and acting are fine. I did not care for the background music. Its too whimsical and kooky sounding, given the subject matter. But the music does contribute to the films overall flighty, giddy tone, reflected in the lack of emotional involvement of the characters. Further, the killing of the young boy is perfunctory and nonchalant.The films peculiar tone and mood I found annoying. Yet, its probably consistent with the mindset of these two peculiar criminals, two guys, both cerebral and intelligent, completely lacking both in conscience and in a sense of moral principles.Overall, compared to Compulsion, Swoon is more direct, and perhaps a tad more thematically compelling.",False

"Not an adequate remake, but rather a reinterpretation Certainly, the Cohens have enough decency to know when a task should be left undone, and when that task is the recreation and improvement of a comedy classic,they know better than to regurgitate old gags infused with modern flair, or do they? I will admit that I did enjoy this novel retelling of the Mackendrick classic. I enjoyed Hanks brilliant, earnest, and flawless delivery. I also enjoyed Irma P. Halls sincerity. I enjoyed the score, the locale, the warmlazy essence of Mississippi, and the mythological progression of events that is so common in the Cohens films. Most of all, I enjoyed the charm of this film moreso than its predecessor.Of course, in deference, the originators deserve their due praise, but this is certainly no simple remakeits a retelling.

"The Ultimate Feel Good Film!I just saw Hairspray the movie at the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattlethe same theater where Hairspray the musical premiered five years ago. It could be that I am just dizzied by the dashing good looks of Zac Efron, but the magic that was produced on stage by the original Hairspray cast has transfered flawlessly to the big screen.I couldnt have asked for more. Nikki Blonsky premiered beautifully as the spunky and voluptuous Tracy Turnblad. John Travolta delivered. Christopher Walken was charming and hilarious. Queen Latifah was big, black, and beautiful. Michelle Pfeifferperfectly obnoxious...the list goes on.The candy colored costumes and thrilling choreography were so enjoyable, and even the more serious parts of the film (though there are very few!) were touching and sincere.The only thing I wished had been included was the song Mama Im a Big Girl Now.

"The uncomfortable first half leads to a rewarding second half....By Maurice Jones Roman Polanskis Carnage starring Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz main seem like an unbalanced superficial casting to some for a lowkey movie such as this, but what at first is expectedly unfit and useless is later realized and understood.From the opening of the film Roman Polanski uses the same intensity of 50s60s suspense film openings such as Compulsion to distract you from what is happening behind the credits to then lead you to the purpose of the film to the then the plot. The back drop of the credits is filmed and placed in a way that looks especially 70s, which entirely gives a delightfully and brilliantly vintage opening of a treat, as something like this is unfortunately rarely seen in a dramedy as this. A starting such as this lets you know that youre in for the creative dramatically playful telling of Mr. Roman Polanski.The first few lines of the movie give way to the two head strong characters of the movie who battle it out later on, but before then the movie centers on the societal dealing with a schoolyard attack on the son of a seemingly liberal couple; Penelope and Michael (played by Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly) by the son of a seemingly conservative couple; Nancy and Allen (played by Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz). Penelope is an opinionated, passionate writer who leads the reasoning of the incident. Michael is a friendly yet choosy salesman who tries to make light of the whole situation. Nancy is a pseudoconservative who like Michael tries to keep the whole situation without argument and Allen is a sly yet focused attorney who would rather be working then deal with the incident as long as the whole thing is dealt with fairly. The first half of the movie displays the tightrope courtesy of the two couples dealing with this unfortunate situation in Penelope and Michaels New York apartment, as little by little the faults of each parent comes out but is especially looked over for the sake of good re pore, which makes for a realistic look out on the stubborn idiosyncrasies of parents in general. As what one would consider to be poorly written, boring, typical or an offputting part of the film is really a clever set up of whats to come as the first half realistically exports the pointlessness and exhaustiveness of how this situation is handled. As things seep towards the second half of the film the characters become less and less censored and open to be their real selves in the confinement of Penelope and Michaels apartment which leads to the rewarding and interesting part of the film. Nancy and Michael are the soft, mending parts of their relationships but turn out to be more disturbed and Penelope and Allen are the leaders and rightfully duke it out. As the conservative couple Nancy and Allen are nothing without their accessories and as the liberal couple Penelope and Michael just want to be heard and taken seriously.Whats great technically about Carnage is Roman Polanskis eye and directing as he is aware of the subtleties and exaggerations of film and why they can go hand in hand. With that Kate Winslet is great at acting guarded and then letting her guard down and Jodie Foster pushes herself to points that seem brilliantly worrying (she should probably get an Oscar nom). John C. Reilly naturally does great playing the friendly, caring Michael who as much as he is that, hes as well careless and Christoph Waltz plays his usual cocky self who has an answer to everything, which is accurate as the fierce attorney he portrays.Also written by Roman Polanski Carnage has a lot of insight biased or not about men and women and society which makes it importantly realistic and in part shows view of the accurate thoughts of Roman Polanski. If youre into or not into films about four people dealing with each other in one location, check out Carnage and if not for Roman Polanski, see it for the rare useful form of the actors involved. I started out not sure whether I was going to like Carnage or not but towards the end I saw the big picture and in that my only regret is, that when it ended I wanted more time with these four people.",True
"The Road of Broken Dreams Revolutionary Road is a drama centered around an unhappy married couple living in the 1950s suburbs. They struggle dealing with their lives, how things have turned out, and what to do next. April (Kate Winslet) is a stay at home mother and wife, who seems to want more than that. She had dreams of becoming an actress but it never seemed to work out. Shes angry, depressed and really cold at times. Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) works in the city, is unhappy with his job and bored with his life. Hes just one of those guys that works because he has to. He needs to support his family, even if he hates doing it. Inner demons and problems of his own trouble him as he tries to live out his life. These character have problems and issues just like everyone else. Sometimes they may come off as selfish, cold, or confusing to us. Things havent worked out, and theyre upset. Thats whats so interesting about this, you may have friends or neighbors in relationships like this, that would never think of. Everything seems great on the outside, but behind closed doors, its a different story. We all have had things not go our way from time to time, but its up to us to make the best from it and move on. April and Frank have a harder time with this. Fair, or not, they are unhappy. You may not necessarily relate to the characters yourself, but you can respect that their are people like this all the time, in everyday life still, that have problems they go through. They may not be as drastic as these problems, but everyone has something not right with them. There are many themes in this film, mainly being love, marriage, relationships, and life.Di Caprio and Winslet give powerhouse performances. They really have a great chemistry together and seem to build off each other. Relationships are complicated and the highs and the lows are really shown extensively. All around great and believable performances with a small role by Michael Shannon, who shines as the crazy guy who tells it how it is. This is a film that will probably be best known for its acting performances.The film is directed by Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty. The film, itself is visually and artistically amazing. The lighting, colors, sets, scenes, costumes, everything is extremely well done. Its beautiful. I loved the cinematography. I can definitely can understand the hate, or dislike for this film. Due to its depressing subject matter, its not really a film you can sit down and just flat out enjoy or be entertained that much from. Its not a film for everyone. If you are just looking to be entertained and have a good time seeing a film, I dont think I would recommend this. Its shows the stark brutal reality of an unhappy suburban couple. If your looking for a film that more than that, one that is filled with terrific performances, great cinematography and direction, then you should check this out sometime. Its a really well made film all around, but be warned, it may be a hard one to enjoy.",True
"Helen Mirren Creates Another Triumph!THE QUEEN seems like one of those biographical features that would be difficult to hold anyones interest  on the surface, without the benefit of knowing much about the content. Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom, so flat and uninteresting is her persona. But enter Helen Mirren, one of the finest actresses on the screen today, and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times. It is a staggering achievement.Director Stephen Frears, using a superb script by Peter Morgan, details the time from the election of Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen) to that momentous international outpouring of grief and love that followed the tragic death of Princess Di in 1997, showing the bifurcation of response between the Royals and the People as represented by Blair. Instead of the insensitive cold figure that the world witnessed as QE II, Mirren shows us that the woman who is Queen actually had feelings for her grandchildren, a respect for her station as royalty, and was gradually responsive to the cry of the people via Blairs influence, allowing the world to pay proper tribute to a heroine. The ogres in the Balmoral Castle were in fact Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms) abetted by the very proper Robin Janvrin (Roger Allam) and the wishy washy Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).The entire production is beautifully filmed with the use of clips from Princess Dis life (and death) instead of creating an actress role to portray her  a very wise choice. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is superb (with a little help from Verdis Libera Me as sung by Lynn Dawson and the BBC chorus for the funeral portion). But indeed the accolades go to Helen Mirren in an Oscar worthy performance  with the very strong counterbalance by Michael Sheen. An excellent film about a moment no one will ever forget.

"Incredible!!!When I started the movie and realized that it isnt really a movie, that it is more like a play and that there is really a lack of props and scenery I thought to myself, My God, what the heck did I buy???? Im a huge fan of Nicole Kidman and she is the reason I bought it in the first place. The movie (or play), whatever u might wanna call it, drew me in and I couldnt stop watching. The end is so powerful, I was speechless. Thats one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long, long, long time. I dont agree with the Anti American comments I read here in some of the comments. Human emotions are all the same all over the world and this movie could have played in any country. Anyway, go watch this movie its soooo worth it.",True
"It doesnt get much better than this Similar in idea to American Beauty but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films Ive ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb The Game this is another film which youll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad whitecollar, middleclass Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendlyish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm Queensbury Rules it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about The Sixth Sense. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (No great war to fight, no great depression), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and its fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say This is a bad thing Fight Club doesnt. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts dont understand. Its as close to genius as youll get and one film youll talk about and think about for days.",True
"A doublebill of THE BEGUILED 1971 and 2017A doublebill of THE BEGUILED, Thomas Cullinans source novel is a civilwar drama positing a tantalizing scenario where a wounded union soldier fetches up in a southern allgirls school, nurtured to recovery by the apparently goodwilled women but also subjected to temptations from female gazes and one false move, he will go through purgatory of his sorry life. The 1971 version is directed by Don Siegel, the third of his five collaborations with Clint Eastwood, who plays the Yankee Corporal John Mc Burney, and is discovered by a 12yearold Amy (Ferdin, an absorbing talent), to whom he indulges with a peck on her lips, a blatant way to take away a childs first kiss (also pretty provocative by todays regressive yardstick), instantly, what Siegel hammers home to viewers is that he is not a humdinger, and through glimpses of fleeting flashback interleaved into the narrative, John emerges as a congenital liar, flippant and manipulative, currying favor from his petticoat accompany to slough from a possible fall of incarceration, whether it is Miss Marsha (Page), the headmistress of the seminary school, Edwina (Hartman), the virginal teacher to whom he claims his attraction, a nubile 17yearold student Carol (Ann Harris), who is sexually active, even the slave Hallie (Mercer, a defiant soul hampered by her identity), cannot evade his comeons. The advent of a hotblooded albeit bedridden male inevitably causes an erotic disruption among the exclusive distaff clique, whose members are circumspectly secluded from the battlefield merely outside their perimeter and sexually repressed, for pert, callow girls, they are inclined to project John as a perfect specimen of their untested sexual allure versus the opposite sex, in the cases of Edwina and Carol, one is the prudish committed type and the other is a wanton nymphet. But the most complex character amongst them is no doubt Miss Marsha, whose incest past and subliminal lesbian proclivity get a full treatment in the audacious script and visual presentation, the latter is even coalesced with a flagrant religious connotation to soup up the films maverick idiom. When the crunches arrives, a mans conceit in his potency is punished by blunt castration and signifies a rude awakening of the priapic worship. On top of his virile stallion credence, Clint Eastwood imbues a cunning, almost overweening facade which audience isnt familiar with, not cut from the same cloth from his hardboiled toughguy legend. Geraldine Page, emboldened by her matriarchal gravitas and demanding onus, doesnt shy away from any extraneous intrusion (the Union and the Confederacy alike) and builds a palpably beguiling tension through the mind games she plays with Eastwood yet holds the rein from stem to stern in unyielding resolution of taking the escalating situation in her own hands. Elizabeth Hartman, the fragile Oscarnominated actress whose premature demise was a harrowing tragedy ripe for cinematic transposition, brings about something equally tangible and visceral as she is bedeviled by the discord between a mans promise and his action, but still holds out the last remaining benevolence out of her own impressionable nature. Crowned BEST DIRECTOR in Cannes, Sofia Coppolas remake is an aesthetically beguiling psychological intrigue, superbly recreates a mystical Gothic quaintness in the closing days of the civil war entrapped within the terrain of a majestic mansion of the antebellum south, which certainly is a scintillating upgrade from the 1971 versions sepia retro flair. But storywise, Sofias script not only eviscerates the role of Hallie (which is a doubleedged sword since she claims that out of the respect of this sensitive issue, she doesnt want to tread lightly, but also can be easily accused of racially insensitive), but also leaves no allusions of all the taboo issues tackled in Siegels movie, lesbian kiss, incest depravity and of course, that inappropriate kiss between a grownup man and a teenage girl, are outright sanitized, and in fact, the whole story has been strenuously internalized, for instance, Johns transgression, where is given a plausible justification in Siegels film, is carried out in a slipshod manner, indicating that it is nothing less than a spur of horniness. Atmospherical over dramatic, it is beyond reproach that Coppola opts to tell the allegory with her own agent, but unfortunately, the resultant impact doesnt meet up with expectation, especially when juxtaposed with its far more entrancing antecedent. Nicole Kidman intrepidly takes the mantle from Ms. Page, and actualizes an extremely sensual spongewashing scene with Colin Farrells less forthcoming and more sympathetic portrayal of a soldier turns paraplegic when he is subjected to an ambiguous retribution out of the necessity of saving his life. Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning dont make a splash in the shoes of Hartman and Ann Harris respectively, save Oona Laurence, whose Amy, precisely captures a childs malleable mentality.So, the jury is out, the remake is humbled by the original, which is quite a shocker because on the paper, Coppolas feminine sensitivity seems to be more adept to parse this ageold gender axe battle than an actioninclined Mr. Siegel, again there is no sure thing in the film industry, and that is exactly why it keeps us intrigued every time.",False
"If youre fond of  ADD and histrionics go see it A brave acting effort that entertains in moments, but tends to miss its target. This film will please some and frustrate others, hence my rating of 5/10. In general, the film is too schematic and too brief in the quiet moments, opting instead for highly theatrical poses. This is more about a mom and mental health than it is about the characters of Diane and Steve. There is little character development, and, when it does develop, its due to external circumstances. The transitions in Steve, from calm to manic, are disconnected and ungrounded, making for random sliceoflife, not drama. There are too many nicebutdysfunctional people in this film and they dont say interesting things or embark on any story arc, but merely prattle their dysfunctions. Theyre wildly improbable and ornamented and often ring hollow, e.g., Steves mother, a pottymouth poledancer, but who suddenly becomes a literary translator; ???? She may be a decent mom, but still bristles at being called Madame by the authorities, a psychological nonsense: is she a peasant, a hippie, or a grad student? Here and there, there are bits of anti English bias, all gratuitous and juvenile. Gratuitous too, is the Steve Kyla interaction. Instead of anchoring the story of the homeschooling within a thematic subplot, Kylas part merely throws us off the track, as she suffers, giggles, and then explodes in Steves face, a moment thats as histrionic and arch as everything else in the film. The character of Steve is a type, not a person; hes an enigma who presented too few reasons for me to care about him. By films end, this (overlong) journey is sketchy. The main plot device does work well, but is ruined by a ludicrous and selfindulgent last scene.",True
"Transfer of Will, Transfer of Thought, Transfer of Propaganda Having seen the two first films of Szabo Brandauers trilogy, I felt exceptionally curious to see HANUSSEN, perhaps the least popular of these but very attractive as for the content. And when I at last got an opportunity to see this film, I immediately noticed the mature Szabo directing style that seems to be addressed rather to adult viewers. What is so special about this very style that is ever present in MEPHISTO, OBERST REDL and here? Its almost deprived of effective visuals being supplied with the typical themes concerning the fear of future, contradictions of a self, nonsense of politics, problem of selfishness, power of propaganda, finally a personal tragedy in a diversely brutal world. Yet, there is something that appears to be unique for HANUSSEN...the main character.Though Klaus Schneider or Eric Jan Hanussen (Klaus Maria Brandauer) also goes through an individual drama, he is different than Mephisto or Redl were. He is not an actor whom people like for talent and wit, he is not a soldier whom the military and governing powers reward, he is a magician, a hypnotist, a prophet who can predict everything, who is able to look at peoples faces and read their minds. Yet, like with the two previous characters, at the moment he becomes a popular figure the politics steps in and controls the life of the character no matter if he wants this or not...Since the film has much to do with magic and unreal events combined with hypnosis, the events might seem unconvincing for many of us. Transfer of will, oriental elements, hidden power, symbols of magic...these all do not appeal to me whatsoever. At the same time, this film is not for youngsters or children but only for adult viewers due to its sophistication and immorality, including nudity. However, what we get at the beginning and at the end of the movie is the Lords Prayer. It seems that only in the most important, crucial moments of life, people turn to the only God they have in their hearts. However, someone may cope with one significant dilemma: can we combine Christianity with magic? The director does not seem to bother answering for that question. He rather focuses, like in his previous films, on a person in the world, on a life among many lives: so unique, so irreplaceable, so much filled with contradictions, so weak and unstable. And that is something Id like to analyze in more details.Istvan Szabo, to the very core, provides us with an insight into the sadness, hypocrisy of the reality we live in. Why are the people so much into magic? Because they have unstable lives. Magic attracts them because it may tell them something they do not find in a regular routine of everyday life. They love Hanussen because it is him who predicts the unexpected stock exchange prices of cotton, it is him who tells the fate of the American ship, it is him who predicts the reign of Hitler and his pack of bandits. Finally, it is him, this time so uncomfortable, who predicts the burning of Reichstag. Therefore, illusively, people love him in spite of the fact that there is also a propaganda around his personality; they love him because he can partly ease their fear of tomorrow, he can give them an answer while the rest of the world remains mute.The performances are fine but one performance is a marvel...its Klaus Maria Brandauers. I am not going to compare his portrayal to his previous ones in Szabos films. They were all very good. However, one fact has to be mentioned. It is in HANUSSEN where one realizes that Brandauer was really born for these roles. His Hanussen is a quintessential of what Szabo wanted to convey in his films. He reaches the climax here. Unforgettable moments! Consider, for instance, one of his most powerful moments when he (Klaus Schneider) stops a patient in hospital from suicide. This is also a critical moment in the whole movie because then the main character finds himself as a hypnotist and people find this talent in him. Other cast include Erland Josephson as Dr Bettelheim and Adrianna Biedrzynska as Wally. Meaningful that Szabo twice cast a Polish actress as the main characters woman (Krystyna Janda in MEPHISTO and Adrianna Biedrzynska here). She is not Janda but does a fine job, too.All in all, HANUSSEN, though a very difficult movie, appears to be a significant work: thought provoking, individual one. Yet, it should be seen after MEPHISTO and OBERST REDL. Then, the movie makes the desirable sense. It is simply a harmony of Szabos with Klaus Maria Brandauer in the lead and their pretty pessimistic message about life and reality.",False
"Bittersweet, emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious Crazy, Stupid, Love. is one of, if not the best, American romantic comedies of the past decade. This may come as a shock to some (as it surely took me aback) but there is no other way to describe it. Going into an advanced screening of the film earlier this week, I had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic. But instead of tripe, I got one of the most unexpected surprises I have seen all year.Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) have hit a rough patch in their longtime marriage, and Emily inadvertently announces to an entire restaurant that she wants a divorce. Down and depressed, Cal starts drinking away his sorrows at a local bar, attempting to make sense of his predicament with anyone who will listen. Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a professional bachelor, takes notice and makes it his personal mission to help Cal get over his wife, and become a new man in the process.But this is just the main plot thread of the movie. It also follows Jacobs relationship with the absolutely stunning Hannah (Emma Stone), throws in a bit of curveball with Emily being romanced by David (Kevin Bacon), and even has a bit of a focus on Cals son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) pining over his older babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). It may sound a little packed with threads and too many characters, but Crazy, Stupid, Love. is able to navigate between each character and couple with ease. It reminded me a lot of Valentines Day, and how its main goal was to depict how different love is for a sizable amount of couples and singletons. Except it failed miserably at it, and stood out more as an example of every romcom stereotype you could imagine. Thankfully, Crazy, Stupid, Love. takes the higher road and breathes new life into a stale genre.While the impeccable cast is more than enough reason why the film succeeds so well in being an atypical film in the genre, it is the crew behindthescenes that surprises even more. The film is written by Dan Fogelman, who is best known for a string of Disney films and the atrocious Fred Claus, and is directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who wrote and directed the sadly little seen I Love You Phillip Morris and wrote the now classic Bad Santa. These three would not be the first group on men I would turn to for a film like this, but their relative lack of expertise helps propel the film to the heights it reaches. It takes darkly hilarious turns in certain instances, plays other sequences totally unconventionally, play even more out with a foreboding sense of drama the trailer merely hints at, and trumps more than its share of genre stereotypes. Weaving between the plots lines, they make the film feel unique and different from others, all while giving it an aura of authenticity. While they stumble a bit in the final act with a series of sitcomlike shockers that border on ludicrous, they manage to pull off the rare feat of actually making the audience wonder if these characters will all end up together in the end, or if they will walk their separate ways; something that is truly uncommon for this genre.Acting wise, the film delivers in spades. Carell gives one of his best performances to date as Cal, moving as swiftly as the script requires between depression and humiliation, and touching and hilarious. The film stretches his dramatic muscle more than most, and allows him to give a performance that does not rely on laughs. The expressions on his face are just devastating in some sequences, and the wonder in other scenes is ridiculously hilarious. It is a performance I hope to see him come back to again, and make even better. Gosling plays against type, and gives an absolutely hysterical performance. He shines brightly in every scene, nailing every line and mannerism, while making this scumbag of a lothario become someone to really care about. He exudes chemistry and helps make everyone elses performance better. Moore and Stone also give great performances, easily balancing the humour with the drama. They are not given nearly as much to do as the guys, but hold their own on screen.The supporting cast does even better. Bobo is phenomenal in his role, conveying an innocence and naivety that is more mature than I thought possible. He acts like more of an adult than some of the older cast does in many instances, and gives the performance a wellrounded other young actors would be incapable of. Tipton is not nearly as good, but plays the role of a confused teenager a little better than you would imagine. Bacon does great in a small turn as does Liza Lapira as Hannahs best friend. But it is Marisa Tomei who steals the show from everyone, playing one of Cals conquests. She is dementedly unhinged and ridiculously overthetop, but never falters. Her performance may be onenote, but it is easily the most memorable thing about the film.If I hold anything against the film (other than the final act stumble and the ohso convenient way one particular scene comes together), it is that it ended. I know I have harped on how unlike other typical romantic comedies Crazy, Stupid, Love. is, but there is really no other way I can rave about it. I easily could have spent more time with these characters, and pined to find out what happened to each of them after the final fade out. The incredibly unlikely pair of Ficarra and Requa has crafted a truly wonderful and hilarious film that is nothing like what you could have expected watching the trailer. It is bittersweet, and easily one of my favourite movies of the summer. And this is coming from someone who loathes almost every single romantic comedy ever conceived.8.5/10.",False
"Wealth at the price of humanity, or humanity at the price of wealth?Wall Street is about those for whom material wealth takes precedence over morality, and those for whom it does not. Moreover, it is the story of one who is struggling to decide which of the two he is: greedy or ethical.
Bud Fox is a young stock broker who only wishes to excel in life. His father, Carl, provides a strong moral foundation, prioritizing human life and well being over profit. Buds mentor, Gordon Gekko, is a ruthless and legendary Wall Street player whose values couldnt conflict with those of Buds father more perfectly. So caught in the middle is Bud, who pitches his fathers airline to Gekko with the intentions of saving the company while everyone gets rich in the process. This business deal sets the stage for the conflict of interests Bud faces, and whether in the end it is his moral father or his greedy mentor he would most like to become.Wall Street is impeccably directed and perfectly cast. Oliver Stone really captures all the elements necessary to the telling of this story, with all its moral, economic, and legal implications. Michael Douglas is almost frightening as the ghastly Gordon Gekko, a role for which he took home the Oscar for best actor. And the casting of Martin and Charlie Sheen as father and son lends authenticity to their numerous emotional exchanges. We see what seem to be genuine hurt, pride, and shame from the two of them together. John C. Mc Ginley makes his customary appearance in yet another of Stones movies as Buds coworker, and as always he shines, contributing his unique personality to the film. The combined efforts of talented individuals in a powerful story of human strength and weakness makes Wall Street a must see movie.I rate it 10/10.",False
"An Overwhelmingh Historical Tale I happened only 70 years ago and so many young people have never even heard about it. How can it be? And, how dangerous. Not to know will always put you at a disadvantage, oh yes, sooner or later. Trumbo feels like a story set in a totalitarian Country and yet...The spread of fear is a powerful weapon used by selfaggrandizing sociopaths. Joe Mc Carthys success is still a mystery to me and Trumbo proves, in the most riveting way, how easily we can fall in that trap. Bryan Cranston is simply, sensational portraying a true American in all its contradictions. I never really thought of the actual degradation Trumbo and the other blacklisted writers went through until I saw it in Bryan Cranstons face. David James Elliott portrayal of John Wayne is chilling and disturbing, specially because id true. Ive heard from people who knew him, what a nice man Duke was and yet...Helen Mirren as Hedda Hopper was another chilling and unexpected portrait of utter ignorance. Ive only recently found out that she was behind the forces that wanted Charles Chaplin out of the Country. Congratulations to director Jay Roach and to a spectacular cast.

"Slow and Boring This is the first film Ive ever seen where Id give it a rating lower than IM Dbs rating (7.5). The movie was slow, from start to finish and there werent any particularly funny moments. I didnt smile, not even once during the entire movie let alone laugh. None of the characters are likable at all and you dont really care what happens to any of them. The only exception to this would be Steve Buscemis character. By the end of the movie, I didnt even know any of the characters names besides Buscemis Seymour. It is obvious that the two female leads are suppose to contrast each other, each representing a different approach to the American lifestyle but both end up being unrelatable and unlikable. I give this movie a 5 based solely on Buscemis performance. Every scene he was in made the movie more bearable. Would not watch again and would not recommend to anyone, there are far better coming of age movies.",False
"Too weird for fans of Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller.In his autobiography Private Parts Howard Stern wrote of Wright: witty but not funny. While I understand what Stern was getting at, he isnt entirely right. While most of Wrights oneliners are more of the amusing, grinworthy type, at times Wright can be hilarious as well. In TAODJ, one such scene is the dialogue that he and Metcalf have in his flat, with a hot pizza between them. Other funny moments occur in Atkinsons office. The rest isnt laughoutloud funny, but it is nevertheless interesting and original. Before seeing this little film, I was unsure how good Wright would be in an actual acting role, a relatively common problem for standup comedians (see Dana Harvey, an excellent standup comedian, who cant quite get his act together in most films). But to my surprise, Wright is actually better in a film than in his standup shows. The standup routine is great, but he comes off far more natural and convincing playing an actual part. Its a pity that a fulllength movie wasnt made with this DJ character, or at least a (probably shortlived) sitcom  WITHOUT an annoying laughtrack, of course.",True
"A sleeper  it grew on me and became better with time I saw this last night and voted it an 8. Since then, its grown on me and Id give it a 9.The film has (at first) a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second halves. The first half is a comedy and theres little hint of the ragged truths of eras, life, wars, religious intolerance that will become revealed in the second half. While at first it may be a little disconcerting because its a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence, on reflection it works.The acting was good (Hultz in the role of Alex, the interpreter, was especially great).Ive scanned most other User Comments and see that some whove read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not. Both feelings, of course, are valid.For me, a retired family therapist and oneworld believer, the film was relevant on two different levels.The first, as history, gave a powerful reminder of how commonly polarizations happen  with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a smidge different moral value system than our own. The second was that in demonstrating the first, it also revealed something in common to EACH of us, ALL our families  that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselves.T.S. Eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his Four Quartets when he said:  We shall not cease from exploration// And the end of all our exploring// Will be to arrive where we started// And know the place for the first time. Jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically illuminating  to explore and discover our roots; what were those people going through then, who were they  really!  before, when, and during the early years before and after we were born? Etc. So the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy, then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies, but through all that it also gives us  subliminally  a message about each of ourselves. All of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started.",False
"Bland movie telling an important story.The movie deserves an A for effort but misses the mark dramatically. The question is: why? The story is evocative and the cast is excellent. Where the movie goes wrong is how it presents the story. The movie attempts to inject a whimsical element in story which is out of context. There was nothing whimsical about the plan to save priceless artwork. Also, the story moves at a slow pace and inspires little if any excitement or drama. The discoveries of the hidden artwork has little dramatic impact, nor do the interpersonal relationships between the characters which in the movie are shallow. Even the attempt at romance comes off as tepid and halfhearted, as well as implausible. The idea of a young, handsome, married American officer, alone in Paris, having dinner in the apartment of an attractive, intelligent, single French woman who made him dinner and not staying for at least another drink is a stretch. True, he is married and his faithfulness is commendable, but still .... The movie does have some strong dramatic moments, but in general the story is bland. Yet despite the movies drawbacks, it still manages to tell a story about an historical event of great importance and significance, and for that reason alone is worth watching.",False
"Suspenseful!Misery has to be the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.  A close runner up is Stand By Me, but for suspense and tension that just gets tighter and tighter, watch Misery.  Kathy Bates can go from nice and cheerful to downright crazy like someone turning on a light switch.  While watching James Caan suffer through the torture that Bates puts him through, you cant help but sympathize with the guy.  Rob Reiner presents us with the problem, and he slowly escalates the tension and the dread that creeps over the movie.  Even though the book was different in the hobbling process, Annie Wilkes method of hobbling still gives me the chills whenever I watch it.",True
"Excellent legal drama Superb performances of all players without exception, but of course special mention has to go to Pacino who gives one of the best performances of his career.  If you are interested in joining the legal profession (as I was), this is a mustsee.  Pacino is an overworked, successful defence lawyer, juggling his heavy caseload.  When a judge, whom he is publicly known to hate, is charged with Rape, Pacino is asked to defend him.  Although this is the premise for the film, it is so beautifully entwined with many different, rich characters and a multitude of cases, its almost unfair to even pinpoint the main thread. A perfect blend of tragedy, comedy and drama, I would rank this film in my alltime top 10.",False
"worth a hundred other films This film is worth a hundred others because it is not an exercise in making a product and marketing it successfully instead it is a statement by a man who is a true director, someone who feels passionately about the world we live in, and uses this fantastic medium to its highest potential.The film is ultimately about a man (Phil, Timothy Spall) who has philosophized about life to the point where nothing matters to him anymore.  The only thing that brings him back around the world of the living is (the only thing any of us really need for happiness)... Love.For me, that is one of the most pertinent and beautiful things that someone with a  voice in society can say.P.S.

"Third times a Charm!I just saw this amazing movie at its Sundance premiere. Its wonderful on so many levels I dont know where to start. The performances are fantastic. If Julie Delpy doesnt get an Oscar nomination it would be a shame (the only stupider thing the Academy could do is have 10 best picture nominations.) Ethan Hawkes performance is brilliant in its own way, however, its a less showy part and Im not certain itll get the recognition it deserves. The writing is astounding. Sharp, intelligent, biting, humorous, with staggering subtext, but most importantlyit feels real. If the screenplay doesnt get an Oscar nomination it would be a shame (the only thing stupider the Academy could do is have 15 best picture nominations.)Rick Linklater is now officially the Jedi master of indie filmmaking (Yoda Soderbergh actually said hes giving up filmmaking.) SLACKERS was only 22 years ago, and Linklater has matured into one of the most original filmic storytellers in the history of the medium. 95% of the movie is twoshots of people talking (the other 5% is people talking at a dinner table and cut aways to the gorgeous Greek landscape.) I dont know any other living filmmaker who could pull this off. Theres a onetake during a car drive that lasts probably ten minutes (before a brief cut away), however, it goes on for probably another ten minutes (and Linklater said he could have kept the whole take, but needed to show ruins along the country side and cut away for script purposes, not performance.) Theres a 30 minute scene of the two actors in a hotel room and I didnt even notice it (by that time I was so invested in the characters and their actions and emotions I wasnt even aware of time, it wasnt until the post screening Q&A that Linklater mentioned the actual time of the scene.) All three, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have matured into their rolls (writing, directing, acting) so easily that its all just great fun for them and the audience. This is a must see for many reasons (including the history of filmtheres only one other modern trilogy where the final film is the best LOTR, and their food budget was probably more than the total cost of BEFORE MIDNIGHT.)i could go on gushing about this movie ad nauseum, however Ill finish by saying that BEFORE MIDNIGHT is what indie film making (and the Sundance Film Festival) is all abouttruly original, creative, unique, interesting characters and their stories, told outside the Hollywood system, by people passionate about their craft (and in this case at the top of their craft).",True
"Pretending the Bed is a Raft The plot of this beautiful film seems a trivial melodrama, but the way it was told by scriptwriter/director Isabel Coixet makes a great difference. What could have turned into a hollow movie only made to make you cry, became a deep, witty and truly heartbreaking personal journey into a young womans mind, Ann (beautifully performed by Sarah Polley). Ann is 23 years old, has two little daughters and one attentive husband, Don (Scott Speedman). Theyre poor and live in a trailer settled down at Anns mothers back yard, but theyre happy. When Ann gets to know that she has a terminal cancer which is going to kill her in a couple of months, she decides to live to the fullest  and doesnt tell anyone about her weak health state.Isabel Coixet led everything wonderfully, and the entire cast is magnificent (even Scott Speedman is pretty good). Amanda Plummer, as Anns obsessedwithfood friend, proves definitely her taste for bizarre characters (whats far from being a fault, in her case); Deborah Harry is surprising as Anns bitter mother; Mark Ruffalo (one of the best actors nowadays), as a lonely man who falls in love with Ann, is captivating and passionate, and Leonor Watling is not only a beautiful Spanish girl. Maria de Medeiros and Alfred Molina enrich the film with their small parts. Everyone is great, but Sarah Polley definitely rules. She is much more talented than 95% of current Hollywood young stars. Gwyneth Paltrow, for instance, would be ridiculous as Ann; but as Sarah Polley hasnt got starpower, she didnt even get an Oscar nomination. Its OK. Sarah doesnt need an Academy Award to prove her talent, and we won a great actress.",False
"Earnest but perhaps trying a little too hard Just OK. Very well acted particularly by Gyllenhaal, Portman, and the two young uns, and a compelling tale of how war can mess up a family, but a little too melodramatic to hold much power for me.Theres also the misjudged Afghan side story, which is populated by cartoon characters. It might have worked better had we been kept completely in the dark as to the soldiers fate, to be put in the same position as the wife and brother. As it is we are simply sitting waiting for his inevitable (rather than hopedfor) return and we know any emotional investment during this buildup will be wasted. It feels almost tacked on  did they need to give Maguire more to do? Hes the best Ive ever seen him btw, but I didnt find him as convincing as the other two leads who had a more nuanced story to work with.",True
"Eyecandy The Revenant is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a long time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also to the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camerawork. Frequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough terrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there are a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge story line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D).When I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great things I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the longer I was outside the movie the more I recognized that The Revenant is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in the cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home again.Still, the movie is definitely a mustsee.

"Great reviews a mystery...I am at a complete loss as to why this movie has garnered such good reviews...My wife and I saw the movie last night inside a packed theater. Upon the appearance of the credits following the movie, we overheard many fans of the first film lament how they found the sequel to be both boring and tedious. I must agree. While I was not a huge fan of the 1st film, I did find that it held my interest most of the time  despite having cringeworthy dialogue and gaping plot holes. That said, I decided to give the sequel a chance after reading reviewafterreview praising the new film, most stating that the sequel was significantly better than the first. Say what?Along with my fellow moviegoers, I found the first 2/3 of the movie to be an exercise in staying awake  bad dialogue (again) and even less character development than the first movie  all adding up to I dont care what happens to these people! Only when Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman or Woody Harrelson were on screen was I able to stifle a yawn  theyre just fun to watch. Too bad their screen time was minimal...The last 1/3 of the movie was far more interesting than the first 2/3 yet it seemed to be a replay (plotwise) of the 1st movie. Curiously enough, I have watched several movies from the 1970s and 1980s with very similar plotlines (some madefor TV) that better held my attention and had significantly better dialogue. Perhaps if the time and money spent on overthetop CGI and special effects was instead invested in creating a tight script with charismatic actors playing the leads, the result would be far more satisfying.",False
"Tom Hardy is arguably the most talented male actor in film today!THE DROP: Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Crimethriller about a bartender who finds himself in trouble, with dangerous criminals, when the bar he works at, which is a money drop for local gangsters, is robbed. Its based on the short story Animal Rescue by Dennis Lehane (who also wrote such popular novels, turned movies, as MYSTIC RIVER, GONE BABY GONE and SHUTTER ISLAND). Lehane also wrote the screenplay and Michaël R. Roskam directed the movie. The film stars Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, John Ortiz, Matthias Schoenaerts (who also starred in Roskams 2011 crimedrama flick BULLHEAD) and James Gandolfini (in his last film role). I found the movie to be really dark but extremely involving and suspenseful, at times, as well.Hardy plays Bob Saginowski; a Brooklyn bartender who works for his cousin Marv (Gandolfini) at a local tavern. The bar is involved in a money laundering scheme, run by local gangsters, and used as a money drop for funneling dirty cash. When its robbed, apparently by small time crooks, Bob and Marv find themselves under a lot of pressure (from the crime bosses) to find out who did it. At the same time Bob rescues a dog, that was beaten and left for dead in someones trash can, and starts a relationship with the woman, Nadia (Rapace), who helps him. A detective (Ortiz), who goes to the same (closing) catholic church as Bob, is investigating the robbery.The movie, like everything based on Dennis Lehanes writings, is pretty dark. Hardy is outstanding once again; hes arguably the most talented male actor in film today. Hes also the relatable heart of the film but even his character has a dark twist. All of the performances are good though and its nice to see Gandolfini doing what he does best, one last time, as well. The directing is superb and the screenplay is, of course, brilliant. I think the movie is exactly what most viewers are expecting it to be, that are familiar with Lehanes work, and Hardy makes it even that much more memorable and classic!Watch our movie review show MOVIE TALK at: http://youtu.be/Xz0G Nkin4cw",True
"You cant get out of death & taxes, but you can skip seeing this film(Synopsis) Elise (Angelina Jolie) randomly sits next to an American tourist, Frank (Johnny Depp), on a Venicebound train. The police have been following Elise for over two years waiting for her to contact her lover, who embezzled over $2 Billion from a mobster. The British Economic Police want to collect its share (taxes) of over $775 Million to be paid on this money. Frank, a math teacher, and Elise must evade the police, and also the mobster whos money was stolen.(My Comment) This movie is unlike many that Angelina Jolie has played in, in that she is involved in very little action. Johnny Depp has a few minor action scenes. Most of the time Angelina walks around looking beautiful, and Johnny is like a lost puppy, almost as if they phoned in their parts. It isnt a totally bad movie; because it only has a little action and a poorly written dialogue for these talented actors. The storyline is not complicated; the mobsters money man steals a large amount of his money, and he is now on the run for his life, plus the police want him too. The movie contains some beautiful panorama scenery of Venice. Overall, the movie is not what you would expect, but it kept my attention, and it is a little entertaining. By the way, there is a story twist that you may figure out for yourself before the end. (Sony Pictures, Run Time 1:45, Rated PG13) (4/10)",False
"Why do Woody Allen films have to be funny?It appears that many critics find the idea of a Woody Allen drama unpalatable. Interiors gets slammed as a forced, awkward, heavyhanded and cheapened imitation of Bergman (most noticeably Cries and Whispers) and usually discussed in context of Annie Hall that preceded it and Manhattan that followed.Well, Annie Hall was funny as hell and I love Manhattan  its directed with an authority that I dont think was matched in another Woody Allen film (Crimes and Misdemeanors had touches of such visual elegance). With the exception, of course, of Interiors which preceded it.Interiors is Woody Allen putting aside his neuroses and directing with unshakable confidence. Granted, Bergman has already cleared the path for him to some degree, but Interiors stands on its own. Visually and aurally its a quiet film, permeated with silences, dark offwhite colors, beige and grays mostly, despair and sadness. Its the existential hell and its a lot quieter than the descriptive terms make it seem.Narratively, Interiors has the fluidity and grace of any other of Allens more successful films. Like the multicharacter Hannah and Her Sisters or the parallelism of Crimes and Misdemeanors the stories, relationships and situations rise and build naturally.Interiors is, essentially, the story of an upperclass family shattered, if not exposed and tested, by the divorce of the parents and the ensuing collapse of the mother. The title, of course, refers not only to the profession of the mother who is arguably the central character and definitely the emotional and psychological catalyst for the events of Interiors, but also works on a metaphorical level. Interiors that Allen implies are those that shatter when the mother, phenomenally played by Geraldine Page, is forced to face the separation from her husband. The neat world constructed by her starts to crumble revealing not only the painful truth to her, but also to her daughters who are greatly affected by this as well. The truth, of course, is that nothing was perfect in the first place  the interiors were simply created to shelter from the reality of family crisis, bottledup emotion, undue expectations, selfishness, synthetic love and conflict.The conflicts that arise, or rather expose themselves, bring to light themes that are quite frankly very Allenesque. Allen explores the burdens of existence, namely the inevitability of death (and the question of the immortality of art), loneliness, the failure of relationships (and thus violation of trust), and the search for meaning in life. Interiors, however, differs from his other films in that it takes a distinctly psychological approach to these problems. It does so by not exposing its themes through situations (like Woody Allen finding out that he might be dying in Hannah and her Sisters and attempting suicide), but rather through realistic psychological observation of familial relations  particularly motherdaughter ones.Like many Bergman films, Interiors is psychological to the core, even though I dont recall a single shrink in the film. Its also dramatic and quieter than all other Allen films. Finally, it would be a shame not to mention that, while obviously very Bergmanesque, the film is seeped in the atmosphere of many Chekhov plays, bordering on the psychological darkness of Ibsen. Interiors is the American film version of early20th century European theatrical drama  the problems of the welloff, upperclass families not being able to survive social, emotional and psychological instability that they themselves contributed to creating. We are talking of people with intellectual and monetary resources  resources that we treat as essential to happiness. Interiors like many of the darker of Allens comedies, is a quietly terrifying questionmark  it is directed at our lives and our values. And the answers are nothing, but perturbing. Little to laugh about really.",True
"You wont uncork a bottle of Malbec again without thinking of this film...The Girl on a Train is the film adaptation of the bestseller by Paula Hawkins, transported from the London suburbs to New Yorks Hastingson Hudson.Its actually rather a sordid story encompassing as it does alcoholism, murder, marital strife, deceit, sexual frustration, an historical tragedy and lashings and lashings of violence. Emily Blunt (Sicario, Edge of Tomorrow) plays Rachel, a divorcée with an alcohol problem who escapes into an obsessive fantasy each day as she passes her former neighbourhood on her commute into the city. Exhusband Tom (Justin Theroux, Zoolander 2) lives in her old house with his second wife Anna (Rebecca MI:5 Ferguson) and new baby Evie. But her real fantasy rests with cheerleader style young neighbour Megan (Haley Bennett) who is actually locked in a frustratingly childfree marriage (frustrating for him at least) with the controlling and unpredictable Scott (Luke Evans, The Hobbit). A sixth party in this complex network is Megans psychiatrist Dr Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez, Joy).In pure Hitchcockian style Megan witnesses mere glimpses of events from her twicedaily train and from these pieces together stories that suitably feed her psychosis. When shit gets real and a key character goes missing, Megan surfaces her suspicions and obsessions to the police investigation (led by Detective Riley, the everexcellent Allison Janney from The West Wing) and promptly makes herself suspect number one.Readers of the book will already be aware of the twists and turns of the story, so will watch the film from a different perspective than I did. (Despite my best intentions I never managed to read the book first).First up, you would have to say that Emily Blunts performance is outstanding in an extremely challenging acting role. Every nuance of shame, confusion, grief, fear, doubt and anger is beautifully enacted: it would not be a surprise to see her gain her first Oscar nomination for this. All the other lead roles are also delivered with great professionalism, with Haley Bennett (a busy month for her, with The Magnificent Seven also out) being impressive and Rebecca Ferguson, one of my favourite current actresses, delivering another measured and delicate performance.The supporting roles are also effective, with Darren Goldstein as the somewhat creepy man in the suit and Friends star Lisa Kudrow popping up in an effective and pivotal role. The Screen Guild Awards have an excellent category for an Ensemble Cast in a Motion Picture, and it feels appropriate to nominate this cast for that award.So its a blockbuster book with a rollercoaster story and a stellar cast, so what could go wrong? Well, something for sure. This is a case in point where I suspect it is easier to slowly peel back Rachels lost memory with pages and imagination than it is with dodgy fuzzy images on a big screen. Although the film comes in at only 112 minutes, the pacing in places is too slow (the screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson takes its time) and director Tate Taylor (The Help) is no Hitchcock, or indeed a David Fincher (since the film has strong similarities to last years Gone Girl: when the action does happen it lacks style, with the violence being on the brutal side and leaving little to the imagination.Its by no means a bad film, and worth seeing for the acting performances alone. But its not a film I think that will trouble my top 10 for the year.(Agree? Disagree? For the graphical version of this review and to comment please visit bobthemovieman.com. Thanks.)",False
"Hope in Times of Despair Anthony Minghelas (writer/director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war. It deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle effectively  Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the nonslave owning common people wrought by the war. Almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not overgeneralize southerners, northerners or anybody else.The film surfs through genres as needed  never presenting a dull moment. It is a romance, a war story, an actionadventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Adas character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as a daddys girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of everything useless.Adas father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. With no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. Inmans experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they dont really believe in, and decides to desert. Nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die.The bulk of the film takes place during Inmans long walk, following both of the protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. An ongoing act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south  a world which is rapidly passing.The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong  emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. And the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. My one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and Laws characters. An Australian and a Brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern American speech, but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it wont bother most people. Zellwegers performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember into my senescence.Very highly recommended.",False
"The Virtue Of Misunderstanding There is nothing coincidental about the human connection but if youre interested in finding a reason for it, for them  you would have to dig into your spirit. It was meant to be and it was meant to be in the way that it unfolds, no matter how absurd, how contradictory, how seemingly coincidental. I dont know anything about Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, other than he is one of the most extraordinary filmmakers to emerge in the 00s, but I suspect he has the soul of a Christian prophet, the mysticism behind the realism of his stories reek of God and of New Testament. Amores Perros, 21 Grams (the weight of the soul, remember?) now Babel the famous, or infamous biblical tower. Gonzalesz Inarritu has put together an immediate universe populated by incomprehension and humanity shaken and wrapped in a bloody cloth of the purest linen. His images will remain with me forever in particular Adriana Barrazas moment with the American kids in the desert. A total triumph.",False
"Edward Norton strikes again !Since I saw Fight Club, I have never witnessed such a performance by this great actor named Edward Norton. The great performance of the double sided blade roll of Aron/Roy is done with extraordinary finesse since he is known for his dualsided acting skills when playing calm/aggressive or good/bad figures. Putting aside the fact that I heard and read about the big sacrifices that Norton did for the filming of Fight Club (losing 20 kilos and gaining the fit and full of muscles body in just 40 days) I wouldnt bee so amazed of the Aaron/Roy performance in Primal Fear. Edward Norton leaves us stunned again. He plays the role of a 19 years old altarboy in a catholic church with such a grace, that even a badass serial killer would be jealous. Seen the movie, loved the performance and did another bow to Edward Norton!",True
"Small and Intense Ive read five previously posted reviews of this film and see no reason to repeat what theyve already said. I agree, for the most part, with the positive ones. And I suspect the negative ones were written by people whose established taste in movies should have steered them away from seeing this one in the first place.What Ill add is, I guess, a mostly personal perspective. Ive found that I am lately much more drawn to smaller, more deeply felt movies than to bigger, slicker, higherproductionvalue ones. To What Maisie Knew, for example, than to The Great Gatsby. Even though both source novels share a similar interior aesthetic, the treatment in the former stays inside the characters, where James focused the original (thus causing one of the previous reviewers comments to the effect that nothing happens in the movie), while the latter (possibly because of Luhrmanns wellestablished directorial predilections)stays resolutely focused on the exterior spectacle and barely skims the surface of Fitzgeralds deeply rendered characterizations.If you like smaller, more closely observed and deeply felt films, youll like this one.",False
"Top Notch Directing and a Marvelous Lead Performance American Sniper (2014) **** (out of 4)Thrilling, tense and dramatic telling of Chris Kyles (Bradley Cooper) rise from a cowboy without much direction in his life to becoming the deadliest sniper in U.S. history.Director Clint Eastwood has made countless great movies in his career and even tackled the war drama in brilliant fashion with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. This film here could have been clichéd in so many ways but thankfully a director with such masterful direction can take a familiar story like war and its impact on someone and make it feel fresh, tight and original. Since movies began, the war genre has been one of the most popular and they continue to pump them out yearly so trying to find a fresh way to tell a story is always a challenge but Eastwood and company really pull it off.American SNIPER is certainly about the war but its main focus is telling the story of this American hero. The main goal of the screenplay is to show people what a special person Kyle was and balancing his personal drama and the war stuff was so wonderfully done that both story lines contained some real drama and one wasnt overshadowed by the other. I think thats the most accomplished thing Eastwood does here. Making sure that the war at home is just as intense as the war in Iraq. Another major plus is that, on a technical level, the film is flawless as it contains some of the years best cinematography, a touching music score and some of the best sound effects out there.The wartime scenes are all shot extremely well and I think the best thing about them is the feeling the director shows in the fact that these men are really in a trap not knowing where the next bullet is going to come from. The scenes of Kyle doing his job were full of tension as were the scenes where we get more gunfire. Theres a sequence early on, highlighted in the trailer, were a kid possibly has a bomb and this here is perfectly handled. The ending is also incredibly intense and the terrific editing here really helps build up the tension of the combat zone.What really pushes the movie from the opening scene to the very last is the terrific performance by Cooper who turns in his greatest work to date. Im not sure how many people could have predicted that Cooper, who was mostly playing comedy roles, would turn into such a fine dramatic actor but hes turning into one of the most dependable actors out there. Hes simply wonderful here and manages to really come across as a tortured person. The film shows Kyle from various points in his life. His wild younger days. His rise through the Seals. Of course, some of the most talked about scenes deal with the depression and anxiety that starts to set in. Weve seen many actors deal with the struggling vet returning home and Cooper manages to bring a real depth to the character.American SNIPER isnt going to end up being the best movie on 2014 but its certainly a very impressive film. Technically its quite sound and Eastwood once again proves why hes one of the greatest directors out there. As for Coopers performance, its certainly a terrific one and overall this is a great film that leaves the viewer with a lot to think about and be thankful for.",False

"Not so much a film as a painterly poem Saw Paterson at the Vancouver Film Festival today and enjoyed to a certain point, while becoming a bit tired of some of its cuter elements (such as the bus driver poets decorating girlfriend) and the modernist or minimalist pace, which grows contrived in the repetition of both routine days and quirky features. The film is a tribute to Paterson, N Js famous poet, William Carlos Williams and to the notion of celebrating reality by recording it in a faithful, painterly fashion without embellishment or sermonizing.If you dont demand a lot of action or forward motion you are more likely to enjoy this film as a kind of modernist poem in itself. You have a cute grumpy dog to entertain you, an idealized love relationship to wonder about, and some complete red herrings such as omnipresent twins to distract you from the static stilllife character of the film.",True
"..only one of the commentaries found its true star......all of the characters in this astounding book/movie were as good or as unimportant as viewers/readers found them to be, simply because William Styron developed them that way: Stingo WAS an unexperienced nerd, having lived an idyllic life in the South with nothing happening in his life, yet aspired to write the Great American Novel; how perfect for a virginous male to so fortunate to live with people who educate him what a horrendous journey life can be. Mc Nichols was perfect for this role, because he was the opposite of Sophie. Nathan was mad and KNEW he was mad, longing with all his soul to be otherwise; a little madness drives people to do astounding things. Kline was perfect; what a shame he has never found another role as good. Sophie was the haunted lady whose life made her that way; Styrons development of her character is masterful. I read an interview in which he was asked how he felt his novel was presented in the film. His reply, I took the money and ran. He could foresee there would be controversy over his work.Some viewers, especially the younger ones, cannot appreciate how actresses have developed over the lifetime of moviemaking. They should watch some of the silent films to learn that mime was the only way to express an emotion. Mellodrama, intentionally so  yet, look at the entire work of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as examples of contrived performances. They were, at last, able to confront one another in Baby Jane  attempting to outdrama one another made it the wonderful film it is.There is simply no other actress, that we know of, who is more talented a performer than Streep. Unlike Davis and Crawford, she is not concerned about her starpower. She becomes whatever character she is playing, no matter if we like them or not. SO WHAT if Sophies Choice was a vehicle to demonstrate her power? Please write another !! William Styron, stand forth ! Because of her absorption into her characters and the many nuances she developed in Choice, take a look at The Deer Hunter to see how powerfully she played an unextraordinarily plain woman perfectly. Underplaying a character, to make you believe people are actually like that, is the mark of a great actress.I ardently pray there will be another role for Ms. Streep  even in her older years  that will allow us to become totally engrossed, to get outside of our own lives, to become completely destroyed, delirious, shattered just for a couple of hours, to realize there is still such talent in the world  THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO WATCH, at least.....thank heavens for this magical film.....",False
"Born To Kill  The best Vietnam war movie of all time SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80s ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasfords novel The Short Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubricks brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience bootcamp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing wouldbe devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.The film focus on a twosegment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. Its the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to weed out all nonhackers. Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes Joker (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes Cowboy (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6foot 3inch, 280 pound, slowwitted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes Gomer Pyle (Vincent D Onofrio), and the focus of Hartmans brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. Joker Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartmans head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Raftermans camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operatingbase near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboys Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.The film is Staney Kubricks best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80s, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more theres excellent cinematography  check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined hours of boredom, seconds of terror feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozens of bodys out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the citys are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldnt even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. Born to Kill  written on Jokes helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the duality of Man according to Jung. 10/10",False
"Details!I think I can watch this film a billion times and not get bored. Today I saw LOTR for the third time and I noticed a few details.When Frodo is stabbed with the blade from the dark rider and the hobbits and Aragorn are in the forrest u can see 3 huge stone trolls in the background. To understand who they are you have to read The hobbit.  When the fellowship is traveling over the mountains everyone is walking IN the snow, except for Legolas who is walking ON the snow. The is because Elves are so light.Well when I saw these details I realised that Peter Jackson was even a greater director then I thought. And for the people who think that there are too much ringshots (sounds like a word from a porn movie) in the movie: THE MOVIE IS CALLED THE LORD OF THE RINGS GODDAMMIT, THE RING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE! Some say that the movie is too long. It may be long but I never ever get bored watching. This movie is just brilliant, may B just as brilliant as the book.",False
"It takes guts I know this is a controversial subject and will most likely not earn Kevin Bacon  or at least the movie makers  any good points with a lot of people, but I urge people to keep an open mind.Walter  Kevin Bacon  is released after 12 years in prison for child molestation. He is trying to get back on track when he meets Vickie  Kyra Sedgwick  who makes him feel a bit better about himself. The movie portrays Walters struggle with his past, his crime and his new life.The characters and the crime are not romanticized. The movie can even a bit abrasive as it drills down to the truth and shows you the things just as they are.I think it takes guts to portray a controversial subject like this one and I certainly think it takes guts to play a role like Walters.

"Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are a match made in heaven in James Marshs biopic...Encompassing all the best parts of films like A Beautiful Mind by Ron Howard but creating its own signature and style to the biopic genre, James Marshs gorgeous and beautifully compelling The Theory of Everything, the true story of Stephen and Jane Hawking, is a sensitive piece of filmmaking that stands as one of the finest movie efforts of the year. Starring Eddie Redmayne as Stephen and Felicity Jones as Jane, the two develop a masterful and sonorous dynamic that behaves as a naturalistic relationship that inhabits qualities of both love and sadness. Theyre a match made in heaven. Also acting as a morality tale, screenwriter Anthony Mc Carten puts forth intriguing questions regarding love in the shadow of someones disability. Do you really know what is asked of you when you vow to love someone in sickness and in health? What happens when disability doesnt allow you to love the way you want? Are you better off just breaking free if you have the chance?The film acts as a moving oil painting. Benoît Delhomme shoots to utter perfection. Intimate in scenes requiring the viewers undivided attention, and taking the liberty to capture the essence of the time where the innocence of love offers many possibilities. The scenes ultimately feel as if were in a dream sequence, sleeping silently as these two lives play out in our minds.You dont get any tears or moving feelings without the bravura score of Jóhann Jóhannsson. Criminally overlooked last year in the grand scheme of things for his work on Prisoners, the composer orchestrates his best score of his career. Very likely not just my favorite score of the year so far but one of mine in the last few years. From the opening credits, Jóhannsson puts his stamp with heavy violins and beautiful piano playing. In the end credits, you can sit and marvel as the names cross the screen with the music that accompanies it.When it comes to biopics, people tend to automatically give credit to makeup and body language when talking about a performer. Past winners like Jamie Foxx in Ray have always felt empty as a performance but people were so tied in with the mannerisms that he brought to the role, which he often did in his stand up comedy routines. In Eddie Redmayne, we get a fully realized and tender performance. The first twenty minutes of the film, prior to the diagnosis of Hawkings disease, Redmayne utilizes all the quick wit and charm to show what his Stephen loved the most of his work and his woman. Obviously going through the physical transformation must be rewarded. Contorting his body and learning the physical tics that Stephen Hawking has displayed in real life all ring true. Since his breakout work in Les Miserables, a role that should have landed him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, I was wary to believe Id revisit a praising session with the young actor so soon. Its one of the best things offered this year.When it comes to Felicity Jones, the emotional backbone of the entire process has to be awarded to her. With stunning works in Like Crazy under her belt, Jones takes upon a daunting and heavily emotional character, never afraid to have the audience dislike or be disappointed in what shes doing. Marsh directs her to astonishing resolve. As a leading lady, Jones ignites such fiery and compelling questions not necessarily asked before in a biopic such as this. Complex and staggering in the way she decides to portray the brave Jane, Jones allows her character to grow, and both live and learn inside of her. Whats most remarkable about Jones is she makes everything seem so effortless. Shes not faking anything, shes really feeling and becoming Jane. She locates all the emotions required of her to execute successfully. Its a turn I wouldnt be surprised to see runaway with the Academy Award for Best Actress.The supporting players are no shortage of talent, though secondary to this type of story. Charlie Cox was just as good in his screen time. As Jonathan, Cox lays it all out on the table, heart on sleeve, and soul bared for all of us to see. David Thewlis, Emily Watson, and Simon Mc Burney are all solid but brief.Production Designer John Paul Kelly and Costume Designer Steven Noble should be commended for their meticulous craft in bringing the time period to the screen. An Oxford University dormitory along with a dozen outfits worn by all the characters can easily be taken for granted in a film like this.Screenwriter Anthony Mc Carten adapts his script from the book Travelling to Infinity: My life with Stephen which was written by Jane Hawking. Audiences like their fair share of love stories, but some of them, rather most of them, dont like the ugly that goes with it. In real life, people make mistakes, and do things that can make some cringe. I believe some of the more questionable and controversial things during the Hawkings marriage was merely glossed over to not paint them negatively, even though the world is well aware of what went on. Ill be honest, I knew next to nothing about Stephen Hawking and his work prior to sitting for the movie. I knew the robot voice and thats where it about ended. If anything, the film inspires me to learn more about Stephens work and theories presented. All of those things are definitely given a back seat to a film that doesnt really require them. The Theory of Everything is not about the equations or the mathematics. Its essentially about us. Its about love, and not just in the form of marriage. We as humans learn to love ourselves, our families, and our children. They are placed in our lives but Im not sure how much we realize what goes into maintaining those relationships. The movie makes you think of those things.",False
"Terrence Malicks Girls Gone Wild Faith, played by Selema Gomez, and her three very close friends plan to escape their boring college dorm lives to attend a massive Spring Break party. In order to pay for their getaway, her three friends commit an unthinkable act of terror. Their Spring Break vacation turns out to be a nonstop party of drunken drug use and sexual perversion that lands them in prison. This is when Alien, played by James Franco, bails them out and a new type of party begins.With a dubstep softcore porn music video opening sequence, it is uncertain if Spring Breakers is glorifying the demoralizing activities portrayed or if it is a satire. Even when the film is not flashing to what looks like stock footage of a Girls Gone Wild Spring Break special and we are with the girls, the framing seems to have been done by a sex addict. This will be one of the most uncomfortable experiences Selema Gomezs fans will ever experience. For parents, this will be an absolute nightmare. Younger male audiences, on the other hand, will think theyve found their new favorite movie. When the girls are introduced to Alien the film feels like it gets a new director. The feeling of a Girls Gone Wild narrative feature film is lost and we are filled with a great sense of dread. Who is this guy who calls himself Alien? We even find ourselves afraid to find out what he has planned for these young girls he has bailed out of prison.As we continue through the second half of the film, it becomes very clear that we are in fact watching a satire. A horrific and effective satire. This is done though exposing the character of Alien and much credit must be given to James Franco, this is him at his best. Through the course of the film we go from fearing him, to laughing at him, to feeling sorry for him. The film is worth watching just for Francos performance. The girls do an excellent job as well. These are easily two of the most frightening female characters ever put onscreen.Spring Breakers is written and directed by Harmony Korine, the writer of Kids and director of Gummo. If youve seen anything he has written or directed you already know what you are in for. It has the core of a Natural Born Killers story wrapped in layers of what would be if Terrence Malick directed Girls Gone Wild. What ends up becoming an annoying distraction is the repetition of dialogue we hear over and over again, playing in a loop. Its understood we are in the girls shoes, things are spiraling out of control and the editing helps get that across. Some of it works but in the end, weve heard the same things so many times it is as if Korine is hammering the message of his satire into our heads, almost desperate to prove it has a point. Through the story its meaning is made clear, no reason to overuse certain Malicklike editing techniques to overstate what the story has already made obvious.The core story is genius. The way in which the story is told is split between things that play out like a master at work and a new filmmaker still experimenting.",True
"Worth seeing but if you get a chance read & watch anything else on the West Memphis 3, youll be more informed & more interested If you dont have a strong case the state is gonna kill 3 young men and I cant stand by and watch that happen. In 1993 three 8 year old boys were savagely murdered. The state tried three teenagers as adults for the killings and claimed they were murdered as part of a satanic cult ritual. This is the story of the trial and how Ron Lax (Firth) tried to help the defense and how one of the mothers (Witherspoon) dealt with the loss and aftermath. I knew very little of the actual story going in. This is a movie that reminded me of the Aviator in the way that I watched a documentary and read more about the events after it was over and found those to be better and more interesting then the movie. The cast is great and has many big names as well as 3 Oscar winners, but at best this felt like a madefor TV movie. I found it hard to really get into and was disappointed especially with this cast. Im not saying its not worth seeing but if you get a chance read and watch anything else on the West Memphis Three, you will be more informed and more interested then you would if you watch this movie. Overall, not bad but could have been so much better. I give this a B.",False
"Some flaws here and there, but still has a very decent story Edward Norton and Colin Ferrell, the automatic great duo, they make a perfect team for a movie like this. Theyre both great actors and will make any movie worth the watch. So my friends and I watched Pride and Glory a little over a week ago, I was hearing mixed reviews on it, but still, when you love these actors as much as I do, you have to see it. So based on my honest opinion, this is a very good story, but the film just needed better editing, it was a little longer than it should have been. Also I didnt really like the ending, although I know they did it more for the cinematic reasons as people wanna see the bad guys pay for their crimes. But Ed, Colin, and even John Voight make this film very watchable and click right on screen. Weve seen a million crooked cop movies, I think were still looking for one that really stands out, but Pride and Glory holds itself well and is watchable.Jimmy is a narc who does pretty much all the dirty work when it comes to busting in on drug dealers, hookers, murderers, rapists, etc. One night though he among other cops receive a call that 4 policemen have been killed in a building with drug dealers. Jimmy is trying to figure out what went wrong only to find out that one of the drug dealers had an inside man who called in advance to warn them that the cops were coming. But one of the policemen that he suspects is his brother inlaw who does the best he can to justify all that he is doing.Pride and Glory is a very good story, Id say though to wait for the rental, but Im warning you there are some really intense scenes, Colin goes really far in one scene with a baby, Im a person who has seen every disturbing film known to man, and this scene had my hands over my eyes. If you wanna see this film, youll see what Im talking about. There are some shocking lines as well and hurtful, this was just an intense movie and is not for the weak hearted. Its like the more disturbing episode of The Shield in some ways. Ed and Colin work well together and are a great duo, Pride and Glory is a good movie, just needs a little more editing.7/10",False
"Disappointing, genreconfused story Filmmaking 101 has a rule; wait, Art 101 has a rule: Know your genre. A drama can have comic relief, but that works only in the framework of the genre thats been established. Comedies can have their dramatic, emotional moments, but if they then turn into dramas, audiences are confused and disappointed. If a screenwriter and director cant even tell their story competently within the confines of the genre they first set up, their movie will fail. Yes, Stone is well acted. So what? Do you go to the movies to see good acting class exercises? If so, check this movie out. Norton and De Niro are entertaining, early on at least, and theres sharp dialog they have to work with (how else could they do their jobs? Dont you love people who praise the acting without acknowledging the script?)But the story – the real reason most of us venture out to see a film – in Stoner is a mess. The movie starts off essentially as a thriller. The plot sets up a con working a con, with his sexy wife, on a prison case officer. But after putting the movie is thriller mode the movie then tries to be a drama about the meaning of life and presence of God. The movie tries to turn its main plot with the wife into a subplot, and then pretend that fun, salacious venture wasnt really what the movie wanted to deal with. No, lets talk about the meaning of life.Stone, then, is a disappointment. Even as a drama it fails: the story dissipates into ambiguity with regard to the final action. PO Vs have jumped around all throughout the movie but in not showing us the final resolution between Stone and his wife, the whole fulcrum of the movie is left blank. As for the transformation of Stone – something Norton tries to act by occasionally calming his voice and widening his eyes – its unbelievable, not fully formed or demonstrated and, like the rest of the movie, a pretentious attempt to take a fun dimestore novels story and make it profound.Dont waste your time or money with this one. If you have to see it, wait for video. The movie is shot in T Vlike closeups for the most part and it will play just as well there.",False

"A more actionpacked Holmes Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow picks up where the prequel left off; Holmes is tracking down Professor Moriarty, a man he believes is responsible for a series of bombings and mysterious deaths around world. With the help of his pal Watson (off to be married soon), and a gang of gypsies, which includes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoos Noomi Rapace, set out on a game of catandmouse to find the schemes of the sinister Professor.Though there is an element of mystery in this film, it is not as indepth as the first film. Rather the focus is on the action sequences and clever humor. This is not necessarily a bad thing though; in fact it helps move the plot along. The first film suffered because the story was slow. In this Holmes though, there is not one second that drags. The story itself is not special, but its pace is what counts. Walking out of the theater, I felt refreshed and glad that I saw this movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are once again a true treat to watch as Holmes and Watson. Their chemistry and interactions are perfect; its easy to tell that both had fun with the script and with each other. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty gives a solid performance, as a cold, manipulative, power hungry villain. Unlike Mark Strong in the first film, he is a believable antagonist. Noomi Rapace is a nice flavor as Madam Sim. The set and costume designs are exquisite, bringing to life of what Europe was like in the late 1800s. I smell Oscar for these departments. The sound and editing is crisply done, and the music is topnotched—Hans, youre truly the best. The visual effects are mostly good, but some scenes were a bit over the top and borderline ridiculous. One of many examples include a woman being thrown from a fast moving train into a river, without sustaining injury or even dying. This is impossible. Then again, its Hollywood. The filmmakers arent doing their job if a sense of the ridiculous is not thrown into an action flick from time to time. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow delivers as a great, actionpacked, and a rather humorous, popcorn loving flick. Note: the dog dies again.",False
"Amazing: starts awful, ends brilliant Its impossible to analyze this film without breaking it down into its four segments for separate comment.  It would also be improper, since it was not intended to be anything less than an anthology from four notable independent filmmakers:  Alexandre Rockwell, Alison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino.The first episode is exactly the sort of thing that someone in a high school drama production would want to do, but cant get away with in a high school drama production.  Its juvenile, unfunny, and lifeless, but it has the (pointless) nudity and lines of dialogue like:Witch #1:  I am your mother.Witch #2:  Then why are we sleeping together?that sound like the screenwriter is giggling and thinking, I cant believe Im getting away with this!  Im so clever!Nothing is at stake in the first episode;  its generally expected that a story must have conflict in order to BE a story.  This has none.  Just some halfbaked jokes and a pair of topless women (If I wanted that, Id skip renting a movie and go out instead.)Second episode is a hair better, but youll find yourself crying Why doesnt Ted the Bellboy do [insert plot resolution here] and get the bloody hell out of there!  When it finally does end, youre disheartened to find that it had no reason to exist.  Two snips with a pair of scissors,  a bit of tape, and we wouldnt know the difference.  Roll opening credits, go straight to the Rodriguez segment.Third episode has some structural support to keep it from caving in on itself.  The surprise in the middle (I wont give it away, dont worry) is horrifying enough to give the segment some heft.  Rodriguez and his d.p., Guillermo Navarro, move it along dexterously and (as usual) have a good handle on visual comedy.The last segment is the best.  I think its safe to say that Quentin Tarantino has, officially, never disappointed me as a director or screenwriter.  My heart leapt as soon as I heard his trademark dialogue coming from the lips of Marisa Tomei as Four Rooms segued from The Misbehavers to The Man From Hollywood.  I wasnt sure if his take on Ted the Bellhops misadventures was going to be any good, but I knew that if he wrote it and helmed it, it wasnt going to be all bad.What a pleasant surprise (still just talking about the fourth segment here). This part of the movie, with its ridiculous premise (lifted form an old Hitchcock episode, which it acknowledges out loud), moves along speedily, and the actors take to it as naturally as any other movies by Q.T. Basically playing himself, Tarantino is hilarious.  If anything, he knows A) how people really act when theyre drunk (i.e. not like Dudley Moore caricatures)  B) why people think hes so obnoxious, like a reallife, fasttalking Jar Jar Binks and  C) how to put some bang in his visual storytelling.  Its lowrent Tarantino, dont get me wrong, but its also the best part of Four Rooms.All in all, the first film Ive ever seen that starts out with a loathsome, horrifying badness, gets incrementally better with each passing fifteen minutes, and ends as good as one would like.  Just dont make me watch it again.",False
"Effective Character Study The myriad effects of the natural instincts of a mother are at the heart of this film, which explores the positive aspects, as well as the inherent flaws of those same instincts.  The ways in which an ordinary person will react under extraordinary circumstances often produces results that are most inexplicable; and when its a mother responding to a situation in which her son is involved, the results may, in fact, be absolutely incomprehensible. And in such cases, decisions made quickly in the shadows of the subjective are often revealed as unconscionable in the cold light of objectivity, a scenario examined by writers/directors Scott Mc Gehee and David Siegel, in their tension laced drama, `The Deep End, starring Tilda Swinton.	Margaret Hall (Swinton) lives with her family in a picturesque lakeside home in Tahoe City, Nevada; but her life is about to become less than that offered by her distinctive surroundings.  Her husband is away at sea on an extended tour of duty, and the care and responsibility of raising their three children has fallen to her.  And all is not well.  Her seventeenyearold son, Beau (Jonathan Tucker), an aspiring musician who hopes to garner a scholarship to study music at college, has become involved with a man, Darby Reese (Josh Lucas) who owns a bar, The Deep End; and once she is aware of it, its a situation of no little concern for a mother. 
	For her sons welfare, Margaret knows that this relationship whatever the context must end, and she goes to Reese, insisting that he leave her son alone.  There is some question as to whether or not he agrees, but regardless, late that night he shows up at Margarets home, where he entices Beau to come outside with him.  Things go badly, and by the next morning, Margaret is embroiled in a situation beyond her wildest nightmares.  Blinded by fear and concern for Beau, she does something out of character for any rational person, yet within the parameters established by the unconditional love of a mother for her son.  Its an act that brings more bad news to her doorstep, in the form of a man named Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic).  And its the beginning of a series of events that will take her into places darker than any she has ever known.	Mc Gehee and Siegel adapted their screenplay from the novel `The Blank Wall, by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding, and its a taut thriller, to be sure; but it is so singular of purpose that it decidedly becomes more of a character study that focuses on Margaret, and the effects of that natural bond between mother and son that provides the catalyst for her motivation and the impetus of her actions.  Its a story that clearly illustrates how even the most discerning individual (and most especially a mother) will abandon reason in the heat of the moment, giving way to the most primitive and basic instincts for survival that are inherently a part of the human condition.  And though Me Gehee and Siegel maintain the tension of the situation throughout the film, it does wear a bit thin along the way, and at least one pivotal element of the plot is questionable, and strains the credibility of the overall story.  The real interest of the film, however, is the study of what the mother/son relationship is really all about, and how affecting it can be, especially under extreme circumstances.	What really makes the film work, though, and what maintains interest, is the performance by Tilda Swinton as Margaret.  And its quite a feat, given the fact that the emotional boundaries she is given to explore are somewhat limited, as the conflict begins even as the film begins, and Margaret is driven on and presented in an emotional state that gives her very little latitude in which to operate.  To her credit, however, Swinton finds all of the variables one could expect in what is basically a lone emotion, which encompasses concern and apprehension, and she conveys them admirably; it is, in fact, what keeps the film afloat.  Her portrayal of Margaret is subtle, concise and introspective, and most importantly, comes across quite naturally; all of which makes her character and her actions which on the surface and in the cold light of day may seem questionable convincing. 
	As Alek, Goran Visnjic gives a solid performance, though it somewhat lacks the kind of emotional depth that could have made this character more than what it is.  Whether it is the way the character was written, or the way it was acted, there is an ambivalence to Alek that makes him less than believable.  He looks good on the surface, and Visnjic does have some nice touches, but he doesnt tap into the absolute credibility that he needs. And it makes one aspect of the film seem a little too pat, as if the character is there merely as a means to an end, to help the story along and tidy up the resolution.  Its a minor weakness, not worthy of blame; suffice to say that something apparently was missed in the translation of the material from page to screen.  In retrospect, Visnjic does a good job with what he is given to work with.	In a smaller, but pivotal role, Josh Lucas gives a good performance as Reese, creating a character that is repugnantly smarmy, a guy whose influence over ones son would be any mothers nightmare.  Lucas does exceptionally well in this regard, and with comparatively little screen time; he uses his time well, however, as it is the nature of his character more than anything else that gives credence to Margarets actions.   
	The supporting cast includes Peter Donat (Jack), Raymond J. Barry (Carlie), Tamara Hope (Paige) and Jordan Dorrance (Dylan).  As a thriller, this one has merit; but viewed as a character study/drama, `The Deep End is even more engrossing.  Its flawed, but its still smart, thought provoking entertainment the magic of the movies.  7/10.",True
"Michael Douglas: voice of the average consumer Joel Schumachers career has gone down the drain since this movie, for now he is just trying to make stupid movies with no sense and style. However this proved to be one of his best films. Michael Douglas portrayed William Forster perfectly, giving us a character who is both sensible and psychotic at the same time. The whole scene with Douglas in the fast food restaurant was priceless, giving a voice to the typical angry consumer. So many messages in the film really brought out the stereotypical infuriated American, and gave us the reactionary nature of such an individual. While this film will most likely leak in to the annals of obscurity, this one will always remain in my video collection.",True
"A Warm and Hilarious Comedy...THE BIRDCAGE is the hysterically entertaining Americanized version of the French classic LA CAGE AUX FOLLES. In this version Robin Williams plays the gay owner of a Florida nightclub who learns his straight son (Dan Futterman) is coming home and is engaged to be married. Williams learns from his son that his fiancées parents (Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest) are straightlaced and ultraconservative and will not be comfortable meeting his gay father or his even more flamboyant lover (Nathan Lane) and suggests Williams send Lane out of town while Hackman and Wiest are in town. Instead, Lane puts on his best drag and meets the parents as Williams wife in one of the most hilarious dinner party scenes ever filmed. This film is chock full of sparkling dialogue and sharp performances. I also found it rather refreshing to see Robin Williams playing straight man to Lane, who along with Hank Azaria as their housekeeper, practically steal the film from everyone else in one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90s. And the sight of Gene Hackman in drag is something everyone must experience.",True
"Lost in Translation.Bernardo Bertolucis Last Tango in Paris is a beautiful arthouse movie that features one of Marlon Brandos finest performances. He plays Paul, an enigmatic American drawn to France after the recent suicide of his wife. While there, he encounters Jeanne, whom he soon begins to have an affair with. However, they do not reveal anything about themselves and the relationship is based solely on sex.Jeanne is engaged to Tom, a film director making a documentary of sorts about her. She questions her own love for Tom as she finds herself more and more drawn to Paul.Last Tango in Paris or Ultimo tango a Parigi was released in 1972 to much hoopla. Critics loved it but the American censors despised it and it somehow gained a reputation of being a smut film. Its actually a deep and provocative statement about two people from different backgrounds who fall in love despite trying not to. Their anonymity with each other only makes it all the more difficult.Brando delivers a stunning performance and Maria Schneider is quite convincing in what must have been a very demanding role.This isnt a flawless film but it is very good and offers more than just the average t&a the genre has come to be known for.Last Tango in Paris has been copied a few times over the years  most noticeably with films such as 9 1/2 Weeks and Intimacy. However, this is still one of the best erotic dramas out there.",False
"Brilliant!Awesome movie with interesting plot and outstanding actors.Reading the plot description one could make the mistake and expect some rather low quality B action flick.Nothing could be farther from the truth.Out comes an outstanding movie which will capture you from the beginning to the end, guaranteed.Its not your typical actionflick or cheaply made horror movie by any means.Adrien Brody again proves he is probably one of the best actors we have currently, in my opinion he is just phenomenal. He gives the story depth and credibility. Kiras performance was ok, not much too say here (sexy as always of course) and Daniel Craig and Kris Kristofferson did a great job also.I watched the movie and it immediately became one of my favorites.Highly recommended!

"From The Evil Dead to Disney....A magician finds himself transported to the magical land of Oz, where witches, flying monkeys and yellow brick roads exist. He is mistaken for the saviour of Oz and must decide whether or not to stay and be king, or leave and find his way home.I love Sam Raimi, the man and his invented work with a camera are what made me want to get into filmmaking in the first place. So to see him handling big projects like this (and Spiderman) was a joy for me to see. Oz the Great & Powerful is a CGI heavy film that demands a creative eye behind the lens. After his work on big budget films like Spiderman, it seemed like an easy choice for Raimi to be the one behind Oz and for the most part, it works. The films shortcomings keep it from being really magical and memorable, like the original from 39, but Oz has enough whimsy to keep the kids entertained and the adults smiling. The land of Oz is indeed magical, with vibrant colours around every corner, memorable spots like the poppy fields and the dark forest for us older viewers, but even in saying all that I cant help but feel how fake it all is. This film suffers from the same troubles that plagued Burtons Alice in Wonderland, the visuals, although great for the story, add no sense of realism to the image. I hate overly used CGI in films to the point of noticing the awkward placement of actors in front of the green screen. The first major offender of this is Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, none of the actors made me believe they were in the settings they were. Both Wonderland and Oz have this same feeling. While Im getting the negatives out of the way, I must say that what everyone is saying about Mila Kunis is true, she was miscast in this role. I think she was chosen more for her beauty and star power than her acting abilities, which is sad cause it looks like she really is trying here. The story for her character here is a sad one and the second half I think suffers a bit because the threat from her is not really present. I dont really know why Im tiptoeing around the issue because those who know The Wizard of Oz, know that Dorothy kills one witch with her house and the other with water, leaving Glinda the good witch in a bubble as the saviour. Seeing the Kunis character go in the direction she does didnt really effect me as much as I wanted it to. Consider that the failure of the script more so than the actors. Not enough time is really given to her for her transformation to affect the viewer.The film opens in black & white and and the transformation to colour had a smile on my face. Despite the fakeness of some of the scenes (not all) Raimi does a decent job of not letting the effects overpower the film. Raimi steers the film in the right direction, but it is James Francos shoulders it has to rest on. He is the type of actor that comes off as not really caring. It works in some films like Pineapple Express and he does manage to turn in some great performances, look at 127 days or Freaks & Geeks for that. Unfortunately I dont know if he has enough charisma and power to command a film like this. At times it looked like he was in the role, other times it felt like he couldnt care. Maybe its his acting style, I cant really put my finger on it, but clearly Raimi sees something in him because he has worked with him previously on the Spiderman films. Where the acting does work, marvellously and in every scene is Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. Two polar opposites that look like they actually enjoy the characters and the movie they are in. They elevate the material a bit to make the drama more tangible. Whereas without them I think the film would have fallen more flat. The drama and character choices didnt really bring me into the story. The film didnt feel like it took chances, or tried to have complex situations for the characters. It had mapped out beats, hit them and marched on. It was nice seeing some nice Raimi touches in the final product. More than 25 years later and I still smile when I see Bruce Campbell getting hit in the face, knowing full well that it is Sam Raimi on the other end of the camera hitting him. Surprisingly, moments did indeed feel Evil Deadish to me, with the flying witches holding out their hands in a deadite possession form. But I digress. Oz is a good film, with weaknesses that bring it down. Raimi and two witches try their best to elevate some bland material and in the end we are left with a film that is neither great, nor memorable....just satisfactory enough.",False
"portrayal totally on target I grew up in California and this movie REALLY brought me back to the 70s and what was happening in the skateboard world. The actors were totally on mark with their portrayals of these guys and how things were back then in California at that time. Im a girl and I was into skateboarding at that time. I saved my own money to buy my own boards. I even remember my mom came home one day and gave me an article from a magazine about Alva. I met him later in the 80s and hes a very down to earth guy. If you grew up in Cali at this time, you will LOVE this movie and if you didnt you will get the true idea of what it was like then. Awesome job guys on this film! A definite classic!",False
"Excellent nononsense scifi actioner...Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful (yet interesting) posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well, I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And Im glad I did.District 9 is a wallop of a film that is also one of the years very best films. It perfectly presents the balance of human emotions and CGI mastery. The acting is top notch and believable, and the characters are so realistically presented; even the protagonist is deeply flawed, and during some scenes I wonder who should I root for.The story is well told; a refreshing, unique and somewhat original scenario, one that weve never experienced for quite some time. The atmosphere is bleak, dark and realistic, actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.The special effects are excellently rendered, and actually give more than their moneys worth (Only US$ 30 million! And the effects were amazing, as great as anything WETA has done before!). The creature effects are so realistic we could not tell the difference. Thanks to none other than WETA for this amazing feat, and I hope they get an Oscar for visual effects. But the practical effects are believable too, as per the engaging and thrilling (and also nonstop) action sequences in the films second half. And boy, those weapons are awesome! Special mention goes out to the fluid editing. Example, first half of the film works like a docudrama, and the second half becomes a hybrid of Black Hawk Down, and we dont notice the change of pace. Its that brilliant.Peter Jackson really knows how to pick a good story and director when he sees one. And I want to shake Neill Blommkamps hand if I meet him. He is certainly a talented director, and one to look out for in the future. (P.S. If that Halo movie is still going on, Blommkamp has proved that he is the man for the job) In short, its an excellent science fiction action film, but not without its intelligence. It may have a few flaws and very few clichés (these happen near the end of the film) but it is still very solid nonetheless. If there is a sequel, Ill be first in line to see it.Overall value: 8.5/10",False
"Mesmerizing  Pure Oscar Material!Oscar Oscar Oscar – Kathryn Stocketts beautiful book is Oscar worthy in this film  for editing, screenplay, supporting actress (several deserving) – Emma Stone just shines – at just 22 years old, this film proves she is a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. There are so few roles written for black women and I was thrilled to see such great roles filled by Viola Davis (Abigail) and Octavia Spencer (Minnie)  both should be nominated for supporting roles although in my opinion, along with Emma Stone, all three share top billing.The character development in this movie is really outstanding – I hate movies with flat single dimension characters and these from the lowest to those with the most screen time are just remarkably developed – even the newspaper editor, the lines they chose for him to keep gave you enough information that even he is a memorable character with only three scenes, maybe 4 in the entire movie. Same for Stuart, Skeeters love interest – you actually like him then hate him and he only has maybe 3 minutes of air time. Great great job. Sissy Spacek with so few speaking moments is great as is Cicely Tyson who speaks volumes even in scenes with no words. Admittedly, being based on an amazing book the background story was already set out and tracks the book closely without some of the details but they have done a great job of putting it to film – This movie sets out beautifully a terrible time in our history that unfortunately is not over – it is better, but not over by a long shot. Being a child of the south and coming up during that time, being raised by such bigoted grandparents and parents, it leaves me pause to wonder how I avoided this rabid virus of hate and takes me back to long hot lazy days in the deep south before every building was air conditioned – such attention detail right down to the Jesus fans they waved in church – awesome flick. You FEEL the heat, the tension, the pain, the injustice of the time but still you laugh with them even as you cry for them  both races  ignorance is to be wept over.However, I think this movie does more, goes further in its exploration of the behavior of the privileged during that time. They were rabid toward blacks but were not that much better toward anyone who did not share their socioeconomic status (the way the Junior League treated Celia) and the enormous peer pressure they put on one another (the club encouraging Skeeters mother to make a poor decision). It visits the sins of the parents passed on to their children – the bigotry and injustice that is learned at the knee of our elders. OMG it is just an awesome, poignant, moving, NOT TO BE MISSED film.Mesmerizing from start to finish – never once drags – just an easy easy easy 10",False
"Laughing at Fear What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didnt this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I dont think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting Ive seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy. Beware of fluoridation!",True
"Stunning  in every sense of the word Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IM Db boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.Based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of Rio de Janiero, where life expectancy doesnt reach the 30s and drug dealers are kings.The tale of the City of God, and its myriad of characters is told by Rocket, a young man who struggles to make something of his life, other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.Not only are the characters in City of God absolutely fascinating, and also very endearing, but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. The stoies are welltold, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever timejumping, freezeframing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas, but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the oversensitive or easily distressed.",False
"Indelible James Dean With short, slickedback hair, blue eyes and thick red lips, and dressed in a white Tshirt, blue jeans, and bright red jacket, James Dean creates a lasting visual impression as youthful Jim Stark, the prototype high school outsider, alone and troubled. Deans onscreen persona, together with his vivid, intense performance, overwhelms all other elements in this film about 1950s teenage confusion and angst.Newly arrived in town, Jim Stark finds himself trapped in a typically hostile high school, and confronted by an incrowd of leatherjacketed hoods with names like Buzz, Crunch, and Goon. They challenge Jims honor by calling him chicken. What to do? Jim asks his weak, mealymouthed father (well played by Jim Backus). But his father is no help. Indeed, the film conveys a grim view of adults: selfindulgent, weak, insensitive, unobservant, and inept.Then theres Plato (Sal Mineo), the high school kid who has always been alone, with no apparent father or mother. In Jim Stark, Plato has finally found a friend. Eventually, another student joins Jim and Plato. Judy (Natalie Wood) changes her caddy behavior toward Jim after an event changes her life. But its still a hostile world, and the bond that these three young people form, as substitute family, is fleeting, en route to a poignant ending.The films characters and thematic tone are representative of a Cold War era in America when the threat of nuclear annihilation hovered over everyone and everything like the sword of Damocles. And thus, the storys astronomy motif amplifies a sense of loneliness, insignificance, isolation, and helplessness, so characteristic of the 1950s.There are things about this film I do not care for. The compressed widescreen projection in Cinema Scope is annoying. The music, which varies from jazz to rhythm and blues to nondescript noise, is too loud and too manipulative. And theres something vaguely contradictory about a macho James Dean in the role of Jim Stark, whom bullies pick on.But none of these irritations can diminish the thematic depth of the story. Nor can they diminish the overpowering presence of James Dean, the actor, the perfect Hollywood symbol of youthful cool, whom actors subsequently looked to as a model of acting excellence and cinematic charisma.",True
"Truly brilliant film I have just watched this film and i am blown away on every level. I think it is so real it is untrue. I would have paid 10 dollars. Maybe not everyones cup of tea but i think it delivers, disturbs and makes you think about all kinds of stuff good and bad. I have read some other reviews and cannot for the life of me understand how negative some reviews are, It is only a film after all.

I loved the camera use effects etc , very real , comes with a great cast and soundtrack also , I dont think the actors could have performed any better.

"Wellpackaged, unobtrusive, tastefully done and... without substance Sofia Coppolas film is not unlike the music provided by Air for its soundtrack: nice, but a little bit hollow. All in all, I would say I enjoyed this film, just like all in all, I enjoy Airs music when someone puts on one of their C Ds during a dinner party (Air is a favourite of many people who have dinner parties that I know). Airs music is immaculately packaged, unobtrusive, tasteful and on the whole, unobjectionable. Coppolas film is exactly the same. Liking Air and liking The Virgin Suicides is, if not a complete, absolute and irrefutable sign of having good taste, at least not a sign of having bad taste, thats for sure. But what exactly was this film about? The meaninglessness, hypocrisy and hollowness of suburbia and respectable, bourgeois society (a favourite target for many artists). The voyeuristic nature of the media (another popular one). The spontaneity and genuineness of the young (epitomised by Cecilia, the youngest sister in the film), a spontaneity etc which is killed off and sucked dry by the stifling, unwritten rules of respectable, middleclass, white American society. The slow but steady death of nature at the hands of the human race. Yadda yadda. Can I object to any of these themes? No, of course I cant. Theyre all worthy themes and the film was nowhere near preachy about any of them. Credit to Coppola for that. As I said, this film is very tastefully done. Im not sure though: The Virgin Suicides could be about some if not all of these things and more besides, yet it remains soft in focus, airy (not just in the soundtrack) and somehow, void of substance. Yet I cannot say I wasnt enjoying it as I was watching it, just as I cannot say I havent enjoyed listening to Air playing in the background at a dinner party. But the enjoyment was never more than skindeep. And to be honest, though Ive been left with nothing negative from this film and the fashionable French bands music, Ive also not been left with anything positive either  nothing that lasts, nothing to keep. This is all just... an unobjectionable lack of real substance with a very clever, unobjectionable appearance of substance. All very tastefully done, of course. 5/10",True
"Awwwwwwww!If you have read my Sixteen Candles comment, I have been on a journey to watch all of the classic teen 80s movies. The girls at my work have been on my case with this, so now I have seen Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles, now Say Anything.... When I told one of the girls I rented this movie, she was excited. She said this is one of the best teen movies of the 80s, and Id have to agree.Its not a real sappy love story, its more normal and real. It has it doubts, flaws, scary parts, fun parts, sexy parts, and the friendship. Ione and John clicked so well in this movie. I loved the scene where John is standing outside with the stereo blasting In your eyes by Peter Gabriel. What a fantastic scene, I mean what girl wouldnt like that? And poor John was only like 90 pounds, I was hoping Ione would have run to him to let him put that 1000 pound stereo down! It was the 80s, there was nothing smaller. :D This is a great movie. I think it should be watched by anyone. Its just a fun film to watch with friends or a date. So far, this is my favorite 80s teen flick.10/10",False
"Lars and the Real Girl I just saw this movie last night with friends and Ill admit Id never heard of it. I knew it was worth watching when I was told Ryan Gosling was in it so I was mildly excited to see it. The first thirty minutes of the film are pretty damn funny and to some, almost hilarious. Very well done comedic acting that is real, believable, and still amazing to watch. Part of what makes the first thirty minutes so funny is because we know about the doll, and we cant wait for the first reactions. After that the story takes a wonderfully surprising turn to a really touching light drama. I was very surprised but I really loved it. A lot of people laughed throughout the film, and I was very much bothered by that. There is a reason this man is pretending that a sex doll is a real person, and its a very internal serious pain thats hes going through, which for me, understanding that part of the story, I felt it was mildly inappropriate for people to laugh, but I understood with time. Near the end of the film it gets a little predictable for one, some would say major, plot turn, but not so predictable as to ruin it. About 5 to 10 minutes before it happens you see it coming, but other than that it was superbly acted by Ryan Gosling who has nothing but an incredible career in front of him, and good supporting roles as well. This is a very enjoyable film, which I recommend to anyone and everyone. It really seems to have something for everyone, but be prepared it might make you laugh, cry, or both. Its a very very good movie, and definitely worth seeing in theaters.",False
"Its an insightful (and extremely odd) look at human nature!THE OVERNIGHT: Four Stars (Out of Five)Raunchy sex comedy flick, written and directed by indie filmmaker Patrick Brice. It stars Adam Scott, Taylor Schilling, Jason Schwartzman and Judith Godreche; as two sets of parents, one conservative and one unconventional, who meet for a playdate between their two sons, which leads to much more. It was produced by Mark Duplass, Jay Duplass, Adam Scott and Naomi Scott; on a budget of just $200,000. I found it to be odd, disturbing and very funny.Alex (Scott) and Emily (Schilling) just moved to Los Angeles, with their young son RJ (R.J. Hermes). They meet Kurt (Schwartzman), and his son Max (Max Moritt), at a park; and Kurt invites them over for a family playdate. Alex and Emily accept the invitation, and they meet Kurts wife, Charlotte (Godreche), upon arrival. Things go from strange, to crazy, after the two kids fall asleep. The movie is quirky, and hilariously funny, in places. Most of the time its extremely uncomfortable, and disturbing, as well; watching these characters have these extremely awkward and bizarre encounters. Thats whats so good about the movie though, even more so than its witty humor, is just its insightful (and extremely odd) look, at human nature. The movie is definitely worth seeing just for that.Watch our movie review show MOVIE TALK at: https://youtu.be/b OI7Zdxf HTQ",False
"Few Films Can Touch Its Excellence.Outstanding production that was the best film of 1987 with the exception of the very dominant The Last Emperor. The Untouchables is the story of Elliot Ness (perfectly played by Kevin Costner) who tries to bring down Chicago Mob boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro in one of his most underrated roles) during the early1930s. Illegal liquor smuggling and other much more serious crimes are running amok and corruption is all over. Costner realizes very fast that he must handpick his own men to bring De Niro down for good. Thus he enlists the help of a young cop from the academy (Andy Garcia), a wimpy bookkeeper (Charles Martin Smith) and a hardnosed Irish beat cop (Oscarwinner Sean Connery in the performance of a lifetime). Together they slowly start to peel through the multiple layers of protection to get De Niro for good. It seems that the fact that De Niro has been lax in paying his income taxes could be his ultimate downfall. Beautifully directed by Brian De Palma, The Untouchables stands very tall with the other great productions of the 1980s. Ennio Morricones Oscarnominated score is one of the finest the cinema has ever experienced. Really excellent. I have no negative comments on this production. 5 stars out of 5.",False
"Youre darned tootin!Whatd this guy look like anyway?  Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin.  Uhhuh. In what way?  Just a general way.  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coens finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others theyve made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaards stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie  the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D.  to Marge Gundersons confrontation  with Gaear and the woodchipper.  Frances Mc Dormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a wellbalanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goingson. And William H.  Macy gives a true onetwo punch playing a freneticallycharged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved  I couldnt imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, Hes fleeing  the interview!  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his fatherinlaw out of money. Theres comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemis violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most outofcontrol of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerrys haplessly kidnapped wife.  If you can appreciate an intelligent look at notalwayssointelligent  life on this planet, youll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you.",True
"The poison is not in the bottle, it has always been in our hearts An excon, who is the unlikeliest of role models, meets a 15yearold boy and is faced with the choice of redemption or ruin.It is hard to describe life. Stories about mermaids fighting wars in different galaxies, that is easy to describe; but writing about life, sometimes all you can say is, Its about life Joe is a story about a place, a place most people might not be able to conceive: where things are dying, where people survive off liquor and cigarettes, where those who are supposed to love us drive knives into our backs.Joe (Nicholas Cage) runs a small foresting outfit poisoning weak trees so the land can be replanted with sturdy pine. A troubled life, past, Joe moves from bottle to bottle and day to day, but when he gives a young man named Gary (Tye Sheridan star of the movie Mud) a job, the bond they form brings direction into each of their lives. Joe is compelled to help Gary out of the pit dug by his drunk father.Director David Gordon Green of Prince Avalanche and Snow Angels and Pineapple Express can pretty much cut on all sides of drama. I think the mark of a great Director is you hardly notice he is there. Like Prince Avalance and Snow Angels, the movies scenes blended so well with the story and characters.Nicolas Cage is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so, no point in dwelling on him. Its worth watching this movie just to see him.Tye Sheridan hasnt been acting long, but god damn, he has been in some good movies and he showed a lot of range in this flick, portraying an abused and scared and strong young man.If you know David Gordon Green, you dont need convincing to see this movie. If you like Cage or Sheridan, you probably will check it out to see them.Green likes to show certain things: scenes that might not be a part of the story, but add so much to the story in general, the way a writer might prelude a chapter by describing something connected to, but not in line with the characters. Joe has a feel, you can sense it and I was getting a little shaky half way through.I know places and people, some that might pass for the world in Joe. I have seen people drink themselves evil. I have seen young people fall apart because of those around them. But, I guess there is always the chance of coming out, and surviving, if you keep up the fight.From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didnt think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.in the end, Joe is a movie about people. I finished this film, thinking, There are people out there suffering and I can do something to help them.",False
"A worthy new version of Jane Eyre with marvelous visuals and excellent performances Charlotte Brontës Jane Eyre has been my favorite book since I was 11 years old. The tale of a feisty orphangirlturnedgoverness who finds true love in a spooky mansion and ultimately redeems a tormented hero has made it to the top of every Best Love Stories list since it was first published in 1847, and with good reason. Its the perfect Gothic novel, melding mystery, horror, and the classic medieval castle setting with heartstopping romance. There have been at least 18 film versions of Jane Eyre and 9 madefortelevision movies27 in all! I have seen most of them, some multiple times–both out of my deep love for the tale, and as part of the research for my novel The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë, the true story of Charlottes remarkable life, her inspiration behind Jane Eyre, and her turbulent, reallife romance.Every screen version of JANE EYRE has its merits. I especially loved Timothy Daltons portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the 1983 miniseries, and the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre miniseries starring Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. I was very curious to see how the new JANE EYRE adaptation from Focus Films would measure up. I am happy to report that the film, which I saw last night at an advance screening, is very good indeed, with marvelous visuals, terrific performances, and enough unique elements to make it a worthy new addition.The most notable distinction that sets this film apart from the rest is its structure. Rather than telling the tale in a linear fashion, it begins at a crisis moment later in the story, and tells the majority of the tale in flashback–which works wonderfully well, enabling screenwriter Moira Buffini to effectively compress a long novel into a twohour time span.The movie opens as Jane is fleeing Thornfield after having discovered Mr. Rochesters dark and heartbreaking secret. We fear for her as she becomes lost on the stormy moor. The mystery continues as St. John Rivers (wellplayed by a sympathetic yet appropriately stern Jamie Bell) and his sisters take her in. As Jane ruminates about the past events that led to her escape, we are treated to the story in flashback.The casting of Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre also sets this production apart, since she is closer in age than most actresses whove played the role to the character in the novel, who was about 18 years old in the Thornfield section. Although I wish Mias Jane was a bit more swoony over Mr. Rochester earlier on (yes, she is supposed to be stoic, but I missed that phase where we get to see her blossom as she falls in love with him, and then is utterly crushed when she believes him to be in love with Miss Ingram), Mia truly inhabits the role, beautifully portraying Janes sense of selfrespect, integrity, and restraint, as well as her passion and vulnerability.Michael Fassbender embodies Mr. Rochester with the ideal blend of charisma and sinister brooding, while at the same time allowing glimpses of his underlying desperation and the wounded depths of his soul. Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Reed effectively portrays the icy ogre who menaces the young Jane (a spirited and appealing Amelia Clarkson.) And Judi Dench, as always, gives a superb performance as housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax.The films locations do justice to the novels often gloomy, atmospheric tone. Director Cary Fukunaga makes excellent use of Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, one of the oldest houses in England, as Thornfield Hall, emphasizing its dark, Gothic, masculine feel. The exterior locationsgardens, cliffs, craggy rocks, stone walls, and seemingly endless fieldsmake an arresting, dramatic backdrop for the story. You truly feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere.My only minor gripes are that when Mr. Rochesters secret is revealed, it feels a little too prettified, and the ending was too abrupt for me. But that aside, the filmmakers have done a masterful job translating the novel to the screen. I highly recommend it! Syrie James",False
"Powerful...and Important!!And The Band Played On is an extremely powerful movie. This movie should be required viewing in any high school. The fact that it took so incredibly long for the then higher powers to admit to the existence of AIDS is stunning and sad. The performances throughout the movie were moving and effective. I thought that Sir Ian Mc Kellan and Richard Gere represented respectfully the signs of strength and fear.I was also disheartened to learn that throughout this tragedy, there were individuals who might have been more concerned with helping and protecting their own reputation and agenda as well as accepting the credit for their work in breaking down point by point the disease known as AIDS. Alan Alda as Dr. Gallo was fascinating. In fact all of the performances from Matthew Modine and Richard Gere to Steve Martin and BD Wong were great. The most important thing here though is the history of this disease and the hope that we can learn from it.",True
"An On Film Miracle Although it sometimes seems that Hollywood is catering to the lowest common denominator of everything, The Truman Show is proof that there are great ideas that are able to be turned into great movies.  Jim Carrey plays an excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be entertained by.  The films surrealistic nature is frightening when the viewer realizes the legal feasibility in todays society, and it offers a great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as an aquarium.  Some things to note and ponder: The way the reallife viewers ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living?  Also, note that Christof does not have his name listed among the real world in the credits, but in Christofs World.  His highprofile mediadriven life is no different from Trumans!",True
"Sterling Thomas (Rhys Wakefield) has just started at a new high school. His father serves in the armed forces and the family has to relocate regularly. His brother Charlie (Luke Ford) has severe Autism and Attention Deficit Disorder. Hes not able to speak and because hes the size of an adult, caring for him is not easy. At the start of the film we see him grunt with delight as he tramples a newlybought carton of eggs into the kitchen floor.While Thomass mother (Toni Collette) has accepted her sons condition, Thomas has not. He wants to keep his brother a secret from his new schoolmates but when one student (Gemma Ward) learns of his sibling, shes not put off.Its been a number of years since Ive connected with an Australian film to the extent that I did with THE BLACK BALLOON. From the interesting title sequence at the start, were drawn into the challenges of life with a family member suffering a developmental disability. While, I suppose, an outsider could never fully appreciate just how demanding such a life could be, the film gives us a very good idea.One of the films many accomplishments is its successful blend of drama and comedy. It could quite easily have been a depressing affair but many of the brothers outrageous acts prove most amusing. On other occasions, theyre heartbreaking.Equally fine is the performance by Luke Ford. Playing a handicapped character is a challenge for any actor, but Ford is totally convincing as Charlie. Never do we consider hes an actor playing a role. Toni Collette is firstrate as the everloving mother. Shes heavily pregnant and when complications arise from her pregnancy, we cant help but wonder if the third child will be like Thomas or Charlie.The most likable of the characters is Thomass classmate and later girlfriend, Jackie, played by Gemma Ward. Her acceptance of Charlie and her solid support for Thomas makes her most appealing. Its interesting to note that while Thomas sees Charlie as a burden, his formal introduction to Jackie and the development of their relationship has much to do with his brother.THE BLACK BALLOON is the work of firsttime director Elissa Down, who studied filmmaking in Perth. She has done a sterling job. Having grown up with two Autistic brothers, it must be a profoundly personal work. The screenplay, by Down and Jimmy the Exploder, is honest and moving and the photography by Denson Baker is fine. I particularly appreciated his low angle wide shots.THE BLACK BALLOON won the Crystal Bear at this years Berlin Film Festival. Its an important film and deserves to be seen. The Australian Film Industry, sadly, does not have a good reputation, at home or overseas. But if we make films like this one, thats sure to change.",False
"Excellent look at a subculture. This film grows in stature over time.Drugstore Cowboy takes a look an element of the drug/crime subculture without glamorising, sensationalising or demonising it. I honestly cant think of another film on a similar subject that has managed to pull off this balance so successfully.We care about the characters, but are completely aware of their (many) flaws. We are shown that drugs are pleasurable, but given a realistic portrayal of the great damage they can do. The crime scenes are exciting but we never lose sight of how risky and sometimes pathetic the crimes are.This film is moral without moralising and humane without romanticising or sentimentalising the subject. Drugstore Cowboy may lack the visceral punch of a film like Trainspotting, but has a subtlety, depth and heart missing from other more voyeuristic cinematic treatments of drug use.",False
"A classics, phenomenal and arguably the best scifi flick masterpiece!Star Wars: Episode IV  A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best scifi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece  the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empires space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire wants them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task  actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C3PO and R2D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Lukes Xwing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi Wans spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70s film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi Wan Ben Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi Wan Ben Kenobi he is excellent. Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C3PO and R2D2. This flick gets a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.R.I.P. Carrie Fisher (1956  2016) she was the perfect Princess Leia and she is very missed.",False

"I dont understand the hate....The year is 1949 and Los Angeles is being run by mob king Mickey Cohen. Now, a secret team of detectives and cops form together to bring him down and bring peace back to the streets.Gangster Squad was a nice romp back to the days where detectives said funny lines, smoked indoors and held tommy guns. Here is a film that looks slick with a nice polish, a great ensemble cast and a story that has enough meat to it for us to chew on. Yet, people seem to be hating on it. Did they all expect another Untouchables? Sure, Gangster Squad has moments where the inspirations from past films peep through, but not once did this film try to be more than the sum of its means. Gangster Squad is a fun film, has thrilling moments and will entertain you. Josh Brolin plays Sgt. John O Mara, a tough as nails cop who is willing to put his life on the line for truth and justice. This annoys his very pregnant wife, who seems ready to pop at any moment. She takes it upon herself to help form the team he needs in order to protect him. The team involves: Anthony Mackie, an officer who is deadly with a knife, Giovanni Ribisi, a smart wire tapper, Robert Patrick, an ace with a pistol and his protégé Michael Peña whose eager to learn. The last addition to the team is the young, hot and dangerous Ryan Gosling, who seems to have found himself entangled with the mob king, Cohens gal, played by Emma Stone. There are obvious moments in the film where it tips its hat to predecessors like L.A. Confidential and the more obvious, The Untouchables. There is even a sequences involving a stairwell, although not as tense and more by the numbers shoot em up, the sequence is still one of the exciting pieces in the film. Both those films are more intricate with plot, characters and structure, by a mile. Gangster Squad doesnt focus on stuff like that, it wants to thrill you. Which is why some sequences in which we are suppose to care whether our characters live or die dont really pan out.It has a graphic novel feel to it, very film noir and for those whove played L.A. Noir, will get the same sense of style. While the film looks great in a lot of sequences, that same style has some short comings, mainly the use of CGI as movement for the camera. Its the most noticeable, at least for me, in two scenes. With Josh Brolin in an elevator early on fighting two crooked guys and the second is when Ryan Gosling decides to pull his gun out in the middle of a club. The second scene in question is in slow motion and focuses mainly on his face, but the jarring background movement opposed to the steadiness of his face is just that, jarring and it takes you out of the film and makes you realize you are watching a film.Everyone plays their roles respectively well, even if the team seems one dimensional. Sean Penn hams it up in a role that demands him to overact. The make up may distract some, but it added to the character for me. He was the one who seemed to have the most fun with his role. A lot of people scream style over substance and this may be true in some cases. I for one never went into the film expecting writing of another calibre and thus I found myself enjoying it a tad more. There are some laughable scenes due to how cliché they are. One involves a character throwing their badge away into the water and another has the classic, character yelling another characters name as they walk away, when that person stops and turns, no one says a word. Moments like these that are played out in numerous films make me yawn and roll my eyes. So go into Gangster Squad with an open mind, dont expect greatness, just a fun ride.",False
"One of the best films of the 80s, Dustin Hoffman & Tom Cruise are a perfect duo Rain Man is a moving story about two brothers, one a selfish yuppie named Charlie Babbitt who cares only about the importance of money and the other named Raymond who is a autistic and doesnt know anything about the importance of money.

"An unexpected good dark comedy/drama from Sandler I saw this at a screening last night too. I was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what I expected. Not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion.I wont bother rehashing the plot too much because I think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better. But I will say that Adam Sandlers performance was really refreshing and real. He was funny, and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies. Don Cheadle was believable as always.This movie isnt funny like Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good pace about it. Id say 90% of the audience laughed for most of the film. Midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together.I also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend/white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.",True

"Gritty and sensitive Set in Brooklyn, New York where he currently lives, Ryan Flecks first fulllength feature, Half Nelson, is a gritty, sensitive, and emotionally harrowing film that meticulously avoids the inspirational clichés of many teacherstudent films and the obligatory violence of films set in the ghetto. The title is derived from a wrestling move in which you turn an attackers strength back on him. In the case of Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling), an idealistic eightgrade history teacher in an inner city school, he turns the attack on himself, inspiring his students by day and drugging himself at night with crack cocaine.Dan is a wellliked teacher and basketball coach whose parents (Deborah Rush and Jay O. Sanders) were liberal activists during the 60s and 70s, participating in protests against the Vietnam War but have now substituted alcoholism for political passion. Like his parents, he wants to make an impact on the world but is disillusioned with the current political climate and, out of frustration and fatigue, (like many on the Left today) has drifted into a selfinduced stupor. Believing in social justice and that society can be changed through education, he teaches history, to the chagrin of the schools administrator, in the form of Hegelian dialectic, showing that change results from a clash of opposites.Dan shows his students videos of seminal events from the last fifty years such as the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education ruling that paved the way for desegregation of the schools, clips from the civil rights movement, and Mario Savio speaking on the Berkeley campus during the Free Speech Movement. To its credit, the events in the film do not occur in a political vacuum but attempts to tie in the failed protests of the Left to Dans drug habit are not entirely persuasive. Dunnes life begins to spiral out of control when one of his students, thirteenyear old Drey (Shareeka Epps), discovers him in the girls bathroom passed out from ingesting cocaine. Instead of becoming frightened or angry, Drey brings him water and helps him to gradually come down from his high.Drey comes from a family in which her mother works a double shift and is rarely at home, her father is out of town, and her older brother is in prison for selling drugs, but she is mature and streetwise beyond her age. She promises to keep his secret and both find that their unlikely friendship satisfies an emotional need that Drey cannot find with her classmates and Dan cannot find with other adults. He is dating a fellow teacher (Monique Curnen) but his behavior with her is erratic and his political speeches and drug habits soon turn her off. A former girl friend from his period of rehabilitation (which he said didnt work for him) tells him that she is now getting married which pushes him further into a downward trajectory.The emotional highlight of the film is a confrontation between Dunne and Frank (Anthony Mackie), a suave drug dealer and associate of Dreys older brother who recruits Drey to be his collector. While Dan wants to steer Drey in the right direction, he is hardly a role model and the results, while promising, are inconclusive. Although the premise of the film is somewhat implausible, Goslings performance of the charming but flawed teacher is completely credible, so nuanced and touching that we root for him in spite of his capacity for selfdestruction. Shareeka Epps is equally convincing in her powerfully understated performance as his tough but sensitive young friend. Cowritten by Anna Boden and supported by an outstanding original score by Broken Social Scene, Half Nelson stands and delivers one of the finest films of the year.",False

"Be prepared to think There is no denying that Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live.  He may not have made many films, but every single one of them is a masterpiece.  That is not something that can be said about many other directors.  He is a true artist.  And it is because of that word, art, that his work is often misunderstood.  Rather than create films which reveal everything that the audience needs to know through the dialogue or the action, Kubrick layers his films with meaning.  He does this through all aspects of the film.. the music, the images, the dialogue, and expressions. And by the end of the film, nothing is left clear, because he wants you to think about what you have seen, and come up with your own meaning for the film.  The problem with this is that most people dont go to see films to think, they just want to see the next Armageddon or Waterboy.  So, if Eyes Wide Shut fails at the boxoffice, or is badly criticized by moviegoers, it has nothing to do with the film itself, but is more reflective of the moviegoers, and their inability to see further than what is presented to them on the screen.  Life experience and a philosophical mind is also required to fully understand and enjoy this film.  If you have ever thought of what role sex plays in your relationship, and what love and commitment really mean, you will understand this film.  If you have ever considered what the difference between love and sex is, you will understand this film.  If you have ever truly felt lust, you will understand this film.  Be prepared to think.",True
"Well done technically, enjoyable to watch, falls flat with stereotypes Somewhat typical drama about another rich and powerful man becomes a hypocrite. The difference with this film is that just about everyone else in the film is a hypocrite as well.What the film does well... the acting, cinematography, and the script (to an extent). I do enjoy nudity, and this movie does do it in a way that isnt over the top and overly graphic. The problems I had with the film were that its another film about how rich and powerful men do pretty much whatever they want and get away with it, while all the women in the film are weak whores. They get what they want by using sex, be it for drugs or power, and in the end it still gives the impression thats all they are really good for, which is surprising being that the film was directed by a woman. While it does deliver a message that you can be a whore in more ways than just having sex for money, it still doesnt exactly punish the hypocrites, but rather seems to blame the weak. Which, I suppose, is what life is actually like. I found myself feeling only for one character, and that was Jennifer. It isnt because she is gorgeous (which she is, but so were just about all the women), but because she was the one that not only was the most innocent, but also the one that was taken advantage of the most. And when Ellis had the chance to help her, he chose rather to treat her even less like an escort and more like a streetwalker, especially after seeing that she had a drug problem and exploiting that weakness. But even after she made clear that she actually liked him, and even after he treated her like a hooker, she still showed some real emotion and humanity. What makes the scene even more powerful is that is shows that Ellis is even more of an addict, yet is still the one in power and control. If the aim of the film was to cast a light on how misogynistic hypocrites can continue their addictions without any real recourse since some one (in particular, a woman) will come to their rescue by whoring themselves, then this movie did a great job. I gave the 8 stars based solely on the fact that the film was very well done technically and the acting was worthy of praise, but the ending fell flat and just played into more stereotypes, which even independent films are falling prey to now.",False
"Grim And Wonderful Cold, desolate in the surface and an uncomfortable warmth in the inside. Meryl Streep leads in a way that is difficult to explain. She provides a truly magic movie moment when she sings Hes My Pal for her supper. For a moment we live her fantasy. Her moment is our moment, thats why as the song and the fantasy ends something inside me cracked. I felt tears running down my face and, I swear, I wasnt ready for that. The humanity of Meryl Streep, the actress, filters through the devastating circumstances of her character. Circumstances that, by the time we meet her, are already a way of life. At the beginning of the film, when somebody asks her how is she, her reply is Delightful. Trying to adjust to this character I listen to her stained, tired voice, trying to be heard and I did, heard her. I love Meryl Streep.",False
"truly moving I may be a sentimentalist. But i found this movie truly moving. It was the first movie that reduced me to tears. And it did it more than once!! I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8. Religious or not! Supporting costar Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners. The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste. Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character. It shocked me that this still goes on in the world. Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously. This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie offering that year  The Fluffer.",False
"Superb I had the pleasure of seeing the premiere of Little Children at Telluride. The incomprable Mr.Feild hid behind the curtain near the concession at the back of the Nugget Theater wringing his hands, looking a wee bit nauseous. It was all very endearing. The film is superb. Amongst the American fare it tops my list of films from Telluride, next to the incomprable Day Night Day Night directed by Julia Loktev. For me, it was all about Jackie Earle Haley. Haley sneaks onto the screen 45 minutes into the narrative bursting the happy bubble of familiar ups and downs of married with children life. The result unnerving edgy tension that could be cut with a knife. Haleys performance is vulnerable, awkward and possibly the strongest male role to light up the screen this year. Haley deserves accolades, praise and loads of attention. Hes been a favorite darling of mine for ages...something I had the good fortune of recounting to Feild after the screening. Feild provides many questions and very few answers. Haleys character may have been released from jail for indecent exposure to a minor, yet Feild does a delicate balancing act without faltering on the side of good guy/ bad guy. This is NOT a film about pedophiles. This is a film about faults, judgments, weaknesses that consume, chew one up and spits you out again. And in the end the entire paradigm of suburban life has been twisted, shaken, pushed and pulled.There is tragedy, openness, shifts, that do not add up to ultimate conclusions. This complex tale weaves passion, disillusionment, love, lust, desire, ambivalence. But most importantly, the tender web of Mother Child relations, WITHOUT ever vilifying Mother. Feild breaks from this poisonous, obsessive, castrating, oedipal mothersubject paradigm and addresses the people who float in and out of crisis above and beyond being tied to their social roles and traditional moral codes. Winslet encapsulates the awkward intellectual mom, who loves her daughter, but has very very human ambivalence towards this 24/7 duty of unconditional love/acceptance and never ending giving. Finally, she decides to give something back to herself, by playing out a torrid love affair with the Prom King (Patrick Wilson) another character ripe with flaws and exudes humanness. This should win many many many accolades for 2006, its a rare stand out. A powerful disturbingly familiar tale played out eloquently, and held at benign distance via the brilliant use of odd narration. Its a strange convention, but Feild masters this as he skewers and satirizes and describes its subjects with authority. The narration was pleasantly reminiscent of Fishing with John, often obvious, but nicely pushing the plot along with often more than a hint of humor. The serious tone of the narrator serves to punctuate the utter ridiculous paradox of the banalities of being married with children and having a flashy adventurous love affair in and around the locations of everyday stay at home summer existence; the park, the pool, the evening football game.The Affair never reveals itself as the beallandendall, answer to disillusionment and sadness of suburban middle class marriage. Nor, the causeeffect that sets the plot in motion. Even more satisfyingly, the affair does not legitimate the happy normative narrative ending.",True
"Amusing for the first 90 minutes Kate Winslet and Judy Davis steal the whole movie. Liam Hemsworth is very nice on the eye. Everyone else is a caricature.The movie was surprisingly humorous for the first 90 minutes. Not all the one liners are in the trailer after all. But then the plot takes a dark turn and really loses its way. The book probably took its time to get all the characters to the end, but the last part of the movie feels rushed and really rather silly, in a slapstick kind of way. First the townsfolk hate Tilly then they love her, then they hate her, then theyre back pleading with her to make costumes to save the towns pride ... Honestly, I felt like I was getting whiplash trying to keep up with it.The other distracting aspect is that Kate Winslet is looking her age and while shes still fabulous, Liam Hemsworth is 15 years younger than she is in real life, and its just not remotely believable that they were children of a similar age growing up together. Winslet was probably wearing her first makeup and heels, the day Hemsworth was born.On the plus side, Winslet gives a flawless performance, including the Aussie accent, which is notoriously difficult to pull off convincingly. Meryl Streps dreadful attempt at an Aussie accent in Evil Angels just proved how hard it is to do. All credit to Winslet. And it was fabulous seeing Judy Davis on the screen again. The fight between the two of them before the bath scene was hilarious.",False
"not the greatest filmmaking, but the subject matter and the journey trumps all As with The Jinx, a simple takeaway is this: you get someone who has a *lot* of personal identity issues and a *lot* of New York family money, and it makes for a ridiculously dangerous combination  emphasis on both ridiculous and dangerous.This was riveting material as a mysteryunfolds story, though the filmmaking is fairly standard as an expose (you cant help but feel suspense for the directors as they have to do literal stakeouts outside of places like the Tickle video building, where as if out of the Jokers hideout you can hear the barbaric sounds of laughter wafting out of the windows, or when they wait for days to find the one car that belongs to the nowlate David D Amato). It gets stronger and more disturbing as it goes along as the directors discover more and more in places they werent necessarily looking; at first they were simply looking into another ticklingfetish video company out of Orlando not related to the group that was trying to sue the filmmakers (in quotes as it turned out to be a bust). Then this leads from one person to another, and it turns out to be aliases and undercover identities, stolen social security numbers from dead people, and a figure who was once an assistant principal at a school.I thought at first this was going to all be some sort of goof, even into the first minute or so of the interview with the first tickled subject who agreed to talk on camera (face and all, not in the shadows or only just a voice or so on). What this socalled company did is mortifying, and all for what is on one hand a seemingly innocent and on the other hand is disquieting; think about the times that you have, as a child, been tickled by your parents or tickle siblings or friends, and all in a havingfun sort of way. The manner in which some of these tickling videos were presented, one expects the Gimp from Pulp Fiction might appear to either tickle or be tickled.And yet people going into this doc should know its not an exploration of ticklers like, say, Hot Girls Wanted where its about the subjects in the videos. It touches somewhat on the fetish, but this, aside from some curious homosexual aspects (and I mean that not in any gross way, simply that its interesting that its all men and that David D Amato is one of those highly ashamed gay men of wealth and prestige and projects that on to others), is more about the depths of WTF that go into this Tiffany Tickle or whatever her name was and how she is really this one man D Amato.Its about power and control, and how it corrupts and makes humans into monsters, which slightly, thematically, connects back to how tickling in these videos is about submission and domination and being emasculated under intense pressure (again theyre *all* young, wellbuilt men in the videos, never women, never men older than, say, 24). In that way, Tickled cant help but hold out attention  not to mention a final, devastating phone conversation with D Amatos stepmother.",False
"Great movie  love the music Taylor Hackford wanted to make this movie for 15 years, and finally found Jamie Foxx to play the title role. Foxx is amazing in his portrayal of Ray Charles. From an interview I saw with Foxx, he met Charles several times and the two of them also played piano together (Foxx had piano lessons as a young child and actually played piano in all his scenes). I didnt see Charles live until his later years, so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed. I hope Foxx gets nominated for the Best Actor Oscar as he certainly deserves it. The music, also, is incredible  it really showcases the breadth of Charles music, from country to blues, and everything in between. The movie also gives an unblemished account of Ray Charles life, from the many women he had relationships with to his drug habit and the consequences of that.",True
"Surprisingly Far Reaching At the end of the film I reflected that this was a far bigger film that I had been expecting. The issues explored in the film really do come together at the end. The credits roll silently and I noticed that the full cinema was very quiet and remained so for a much longer time than usual.The problems in the Catholic church have had repercussions and this parish in Sligo is losing its faith. This loss of faith is portrayed very vividly, it is expressed more strongly than in reality I think.The film revolves around the character of Father James Lavelle played powerfully by Brendan Gleeson. As Father James visits his parishioners there is much humour, often quite dark. The script has many choice lines. A man arrives to give a lift to a female parishioner who has been sexually promiscuous and she says here is my ride.Father James Lavelle is a likable priest, grappling with applying the churchs teachings in the modern world. It is a thankless task and always his objective is undermined by the failures of the church itself. Father Jamess character is contrasted with that of a younger priest he shares the parish with (David Wilmot). The younger priest is very much part of the institution of the church and his loyal naïvety is humorous and infuriating.Father James life is threatened at the beginning, but this film is not a detective story, it is not Father Brown. Father James knows who threatened him but we the audience are not let in on the secret. The logic behind the threat is described ingeniously as events in the film come to a head at the end.",False
"Back to the spirit of the Black Pearl These Pirates films are all about entertainment and thankfully this latest adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow at the helm is back to basics, reminding me of the formula that made the very first one, Curse of the Black pearl so great. Dont worry I wont give anything away here but be aware that the opening 20 minutes is one funny sequence and quirky one liner after another. There is also a couple of hilarious cameos, one may be familiar but the other was a right royal shock. Depp walks through his lethargic swaying pirate character with ultimate ease, while new high seas bad boy Blackbeard is exceptional, but not as cool as Sparrows former flame played by Cruz. She is foxy, feisty and funny. The action is elevated by some wonderful 3D effects but I am sure the film would be just as rocking without it. Finally, the highlight is the Mermaid scenes. As dark as they are, they take the viewer into their web of intrigue. Australian Gemma Ward even sings during an evocative moment. Remember to stay on after the credits for an EXTRA scene. After the last two installments left me crying with disappointment, I Loved it.",False
"A Subtle Horror To me The Conversation is one of most underrated movies ever. The movie carries on so quietly throughout that the suspense of the movie keeps on building up to one of the best endings in movie history.The directing of this film was among one of the best I have ever seen. Coppola is able to craft his way through another one of his classics. The movie is just perfectly edited together and is so gripping throughout. His directing really takes the audiene to another world that most to almost all of us do not know about. That world is the world of security surveillance and spies. This though is not an ordinary spy movie, it is a very realistic psychological portrayal and the affects of knowing the real truth. Instead of this movie becoming a complete flop it becomes better and better as it carries on. Along with the cinematography and music he makes the audience feel how remote and controlled our society is. Coppola did not just show it he gave you the actual feeling of it. Coppola deserves much of the credit for this.The writing was very good too. Once again Coppola uses his writing to keep the audience very much engaged into the movie. The writing in this movie ranks up their with his other screenplays such as The Godfather series, Apocalypse Now and Patton.The acting was a bit of surprise to me. It was better than I expected. This film convinced me that Gene Hackman is prime talent. He is not just a man who plays the man always involved in a shouting match but in fact he is a versatile actor who has really limited himself rather than his abilities limiting him. He was perfect for this movie. The supporting cast was great as well. Robert Duvall who always gives the best cameos was good in here too. Harrison Ford who I wish actually had some more screen time was very convincing as a manipulative high ranking executive.The ending in this movie to me is one of the best ever. It shows how or fears can consume us and alter our live. It displays how if our fears consume us we lose the feeling of life itself. That is at least my take of it. This is Coppolas hidden masterpiece that should be seen by all. It will definitely make you think.",False
"A beautiful fable for now and the future I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words dont grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the tradeoffs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrests character terms it very well with this quote,I think it is a little bit of both. From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!",True
"brilliantly crafted Stephen King adaptation This film has it all: brilliant script, superb direction, great acting. Its a revenge melodrama, a dysfunctional family drama, a mystery/thriller, and a feminist take on the womans picture, all rolled into one. Sixty years ago, Bette Davis would have had a field day with the title role, but back then Hollywood would never have had the nerve to make a picture with so radical a sociopolitical point of view. Hackford virtually reinvents the use of flashbacks, and the eclipse sequence is a classic. This film was pretty much ignored by critics when it was released, but it will be around long after most of 1995s films have passed into oblivion.",False
"The Surrealistic and Imaginary World of Terry Gilliam In London, the sideshow troupe of Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) promises to the audiences a journey to the Imaginarium, an imaginary world commanded by the mind of Doctor Parnassus where dreams come true. In the stories that Doctor Parnassus tells to his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), to the midget Percy (Verne Troyer), and his assistant Anton (Andrew Garfield), he claims to have more than one thousand years; however, when he felt in love for a mortal, he made a deal with the devil Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) trading his immortality per youth. As part of the bargain, he promised his son or daughter to Mr. Nick on the sixteenth birthday. Valentina now is almost in the doomed age and Doctor Parnassus bets with Mr. Nick that whoever seduces five souls in the Imaginarium will have Valentina as a prize. Meanwhile the troupe rescues Tony (Heath Ledger) that was hanged on a bridge by the Russians that explains why he had been chased and he joins the group. Tony and Valentina fall in love for each other and the jealous Anton discovers that his competitor is a liar.The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is another original movie with the surrealistic and imaginary world of Terry Gilliam and last work of Heath Ledger that had to be replaced by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell in the Imaginarium to complete the missing scenes. Further, the trio of actors has donated their income with this film to Heath Ledgers daughter to guarantee her financial situation in the future in magnanimous attitudes. The duel between Doctor Parnassus and Mr. Nick together with the vision of the world of fantasy of Terry Gilliam is awesome. For those that liked this movie, I would like to recommend the also surrealistic O Homem Que Desafiou o Diabo. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): O Imaginário Mundo do Doutor Parnassus (The Imaginary World of Doctor Parnassus)",False
"Classic Masterpiece I remember when i was a kid and i got this on video and i watched it so many times. But later, video got deleted :(. Well about 7 years i bought it for DVD and it was so huge masterpiece, what i didnt notice. This classical film should be top 250. Characters are so good. Michael Keaton is the best Batman by far. Jack Nicholson has really great lines and hes really good as The Joker. A reason why this movie is such a great is cause of its music sequences. This is what we need, we need music all the time in the movies. Other reason is its really entertaining with epic humors by The Joker. The story is great. Batman notices that Joker is the guy, who killed his parents. Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight is classic. The end of the film is a full off excellent action and it ends really good with great music.A movie is not hard to make. It just needs to get great director as Tim Burton and great actors.",False
"Exhausting I heard a great New Yorker Radio Hour podcast about the film, so I dove in with high hopes. But it was a slog. Im a big fan of Dustin Hoffman, but he must have been directed to wear out the audience, which he does quite effectively.

"Spaced  Out Bikers In this counterculture film, we have a spacedout trio of Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and a funny Jack Nicholson tooling down the highway, on motorcycles and stuff, en route from L.A. to Mardi Gras. As artistic expression during an angry era of war and social change, the film communicates a powerful philosophy, in lieu of a complex plot.Most scenes take place outdoors, in the American South and Southwest. Laszlo Kovacs adroit cinematography, combined with an expansive soundtrack, hippie lingo, and cool clothes, convey the films underlying message of individual freedom and nonconformity. The film is significant in that it was one of several successful 60s films made by individuals outside the traditional Hollywood studio structure.

"A Chinatown for the 1990s L.A. Confidential is brilliant.  The screenplay and direction are secondtonone.  The performances by the ensemble cast are also superb. Kim Basinger stands out the most with her Oscarwinning role.  Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, and Danny De Vito all have their moments as well.  The film deals with the seamy side of Los Angeles in the post World War II 1950s.  Los Angeles is a place of shady dealings and police corruption.  To add to those problems is the creation of the smutty tabloid.  Multilayered and smart, L.A. Confidential will be the greatest survivor of the films released in 1997. 5 out of 5 stars.",True
"Surprised I am an aircraft mechanic, so admittedly I have trouble watching a movie which will undoubtedly abuse reality in terms of physics and aircraft design. I recall seeing previews for this and being stunned at the laughable scenario of an inverted passenger plane. That experience dropped my expectation to essentially zero.When I watched this film I was surprised in two ways. Firstly, the scenario was more plausible than I had given it credit. Inverted flight is a problem for most planes because of aerodynamics. And while some aircraft are aerodynamically capable of inverted flight (even some passenger planes) it is additionally a problem because hydraulic and engine oil systems are often gravity fed. This means that if a plane is able to fly this way, most of them wont fly for long before systems begin to fail. The film did a reasonable job of portraying this as the plane was just barely able to sustain level flight with a full pitch down elevator position and displayed low engine oil press warnings which led to engine fire. I suspect the roll maneuver would require more altitude than the film suggests...but otherwise its not far from what could happen in reality if this was actually attempted. Most engine fire Thandles are designed to instantly shut fuel and bleed air valves for an engine...which doesnt seem to happen here, but that was my biggest realism gripe.My second surprise is that this movie has very little to do with aviation. Aviation seems to be the setting for the story, but the subject itself is substance abuse. The story could have just as easily been set around a bus driver or a ship captain. Given the fact that aviation was merely a setting for the story I have to give credit to the film makers for paying at least some attention to realism.I thought the story was fascinating. Its the sort of film that requires something of the viewer. You cant watch this without making moral judgements and that process requires each viewer to evaluate how they feel about certain subjects. The story creates just enough moral dilemma to get people thinking and any story that can succeed in that gets a pass from me.",True
"Another solid and subtle film coming out of Australia. Catch it.I dont know what it is about Australian cinema and filmmakers these past 15 years, but they are just getting better and better. OK, so we here in the Northern Hemisphere dont necessarily get to see the dross. Granted. But what we do see shows that theres talent galore down under. There are, of course, talented actors, writers, cinematographers and directors around the world, but at the moment Australia seems to have found its own voice, its own style which is not just unique, but interesting, accomplished and gripping.Unlike so much highenergy Hollywood dreck, Animal Kingdom relies on a good script, a gripping story, good acting, solid characterisation and great directing. There is no gratuitous flashiness to cover up bald patches. This particular films style is minimalist, the camera handheld (as far as I can see) throughout. But that doesnt lead to tricksy artiness.It allows the actors to act  its what they do best after all  with none of them falling back onto the schtick they are always hired for  Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise, you get the picture. All I can say is if you get the chance to catch this, catch it. Oh, and keep making them, Australia.",False
"A Very Depressing Movie It is strange how much this movie was ignored. It doesnt rank on many critics top 10 list and it wasnt a huge box office success anyway. Weird considering it is one of Kevin spaceys best performances. I almost cried at the end so the movie achieved what it set out to achieve.The movie is about a man named David Gale(Kevin Spacey) who is a philosophy professor and also a antideath penalty campaigner. He was arrested some time ago and convicted on the crime of raping and murdering a fellow death penalty campaigner named Constance(the gorgeous Laura Linney). He has been given a death sentence. He asks for a reporter during his last week to tell the real story supposedly. That reporter is Bitsey Bloom(Kate winslet) who shows a genuine disinterest at first towards the case but who has a reputation of reporting on difficult and controversial stories. Bitsey bloom travels with her partner Zack to the facility where Gale is held.The movie has many twists and turns showing the collapse of David Gales life as he changes from respected philosophy professor to an ostracised man because of some events in his life. These scenes are quite sad and depressing and Gale doesnt have many friends who stand by him in the hour of need. The way the movie flows is actually quite excellent and the revelation in the middle is quite surprising. It doesnt seem like a gimmick and thats where the movie triumphs.The performances are quite amazing. Kevin Spacey as David Gale has given one of the best performances in his career and Laura Linney as Constance is cute,smart and amazingly compassionate. Kate winslet as Bitsey Bloom also gives a great performance as a woman who starts off as indifferent to the case but then transforms into a woman who feels genuine sympathy for the plight of David Gale. The background music is also quite amazing and this is one of the best in movies. At the very least it should have gotten an award for this category. The music at certain points is quite emotional and towards the end it is one of the reasons for the beautiful climax.The only problem I have might be the rewatchability factor. I think I might not watch it again. Maybe because it is too depressing. But it should be definitely watched by people who are interested in the issue of death penalty and its accompanying ethical questions. The questions raised by David Gale in the interview with the Texas governor are one of the best examples. That scene alone is enough for people to watch this movie. The movie is also an example of how one mistake changes the life of a respected person in society and how quickly things can change in life if we are not careful about everything we do. So in essence it is not just a movie for death penalty campaigners and those who are interested in the concept of death penalty. But it is also a movie for people who are interested in human nature in general.9/10",True
"Fantasy and Reality Entwined In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, in the pediatric wing of a hospital in Los Angeles, the talkative five yearold girl Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) is recovering from a broken arm. Alexandria works with her family of immigrants in the harvest of oranges and she has just lost her father. When she meets the injured stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) recovering from a fall and also brokenhearted with the loss of his girlfriend to the lead actor, he begins to tell a fantastic tale about six heroes and their common enemy, the hideous Governor Odious. Black Bandit that lost his brother Blue Bandit that was killed by Odious men; the expert in explosives Luigi that was outcast in his town by Odious; the Indian that lost his gorgeous wife that was abducted by Odious; the former slave Otta Benga that lost his twin brother in the fields of Odious; Charles Darwin that receives a rare Mistica Americana butterfly killed by Odious; and Mystic that hated Odious that destroyed the fauna and flora of his lands, join forces to defeat the evil Odious. While Alexandria fantasizes the story projecting the images of her acquaintances in the characters, the heartsick Roy uses her innocence to ask the girl to still morphine and medicines from the dispensary for him to commit suicide. The Fall is one of the most original films that I have recently watched. This adventure has a stunning opening sequence in black and white and slow motion with the Allegretto from Ludwig van Beethovens (17701827) Symphony # 7 in A mayor, Opus 92 in the soundtrack. The story entwines reality and fiction, burring the situations in a certain moment, and may be understood in many layers; therefore this dramatic feature can also been seen by children and is a great family entertainment. The cinematography sets and locations are very beautiful and bright with intense use of colors. This is the type of movie that deserves to be watched more than once to have the full understanding of all situations. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): Dublê de Anjo (Stunt of Angel)",False

Jennifer Garners character is all about protecting her daughter on the internet. She is paranoid that her daughter will come across a predator and she is just over protective.

I dont think its any more predictable than an average Hollywood film; I find most action films much more predictable and shallow.The most beautiful thing about the movie (as about Hallström movies generally) is the wise, warmhearted story about things that matter: love, sincerity, tolerance, standing up for the things you believe are righteous and good, and enjoying the simple pleasures in life, like a good dinner with friends, or like chocolate :) And Hallström tells his stories so delicately, in his very own style, with fine nuances and a twinkle of humour in his eye. Binoche, Dench, Depp, Molina, Thivisol etc. are fantastic.
Im so glad I saw the movie. It always makes me think and feel a lot.",False
"A Classic not to be Missed The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boys life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boys life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a shorttempered loud mouth to a straight laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and peoples different personality traits. This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young mans life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",True
"Beautiful film.  A gem!I saw Mr Nobody last night in a jampacked theatre. I guess that the main reason for this is that I am in Belgium and the writer/director is Belgian. The response of the audience was amazing. I was in Flanders and so the film wasnt dubbed.The film is magical and surreal. And yet it makes sense. Not many have achieved this, but Jaco Van Dormael seems to have done it with ease. It did take him 13 years however. If you liked Toto Le Héro, you should love this film too. Switching between the UK and Canada works brilliantly and Jared Leto, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple steal the show. Ifans and Little are also fantastic. Diane Krugers strong German accent is unfortunate as the film needs no unintentional surrealism added to it. I think her role needed a stronger actress (she looks very beautiful though).In all I recommend everyone to go and see it. The only reason the film gets an 8 (and not a higher score) is because towards the end it seemed to go on a bit. I will go and see it again however. The story really draws you in and I need to go back to search for some answers. I also want to see it again because it is so beautifully filmed. Van Dormael is an artist.I enjoyed this film as much, if not more, than a David Lynch. And that truly is a compliment.",True
"Duplass Brothers not ruined by Hollywood budget Walking down Henry Street on a Saturday afternoon, a particular type of teenager can be spotted. They shuffle from shop to shop, overweight, insecure and accompanied by their Mammy. We now have a name for them; Cyrus.Sad sack John (John C. Reilly) has never really gotten over his ex wife. His dependency on her, seven years after their divorce, is still obvious, so he decides its time to start looking for someone new. The fact that he has a face thats a cross between Beethoven and Shrek doesnt really help his chances but, against the odds, he manages to find the beautiful Molly (Marisa Tomei). All goes swimmingly at first, until John meets Cyrus. Mollys 20yearold unemployed son Cyrus is morbidly obese and morbidly dependant on her. Their relationship is a little, shall we say, a little Oedipal. Scrap that, a lot Oedipal. Obviously Cyrus isnt going to take to well to his new Dad but what follows is a subtle masterclass in passive aggressive oneupmanship.In the wrong hands Cyrus could have been 90 minutes of breast feeding gags and a series of Jackassstyle pranks. Luckily for us we are dealing with Jay and Mark Duplass, the golden boys of Mumblecore. For those unfamiliar with the sub genre, Mumblecore refers to a film movement which came out of North America at the turn of the millennium. The films are all made on micro budgets, focus on the relationships of twentysomethings and rely on improvisation. Basically they are the bastard children of Slackers and Woody Allens Manhattan.This is the first outing for the Duplass brothers with a reasonable budget and some well known faces. Thankfully theyve retained their indie cinema sensibilties and understand the elements that made their early work enjoyable. The dialogue is still mainly improvised and the camera work is still mostly handheld and makes use of a lot of snapzoom. Cyrus has been marketed as a comedy and there are laughs scattered throughout, the humour however is closer to the Coen brothers than Judd Apatow. However its the dramatic elements of the narrative that really give the cast something to get their teeth into. John C. Reilly here echoes his performance in Paul T. Andersons Magnolia. Both characters are essentially losers, but theres something undeniably likable and sweet about them. Jonah Hill as the titular character really impresses. Fears that he would forever be typecast as a ranty, horny chubby funster are alleviated. He knows how to take a scene forward, he knows when to be serious and most importantly he knows that subtlety can often be far funnier than farce.Many many people will hate Cyrus and I can see why, the camera work is distracting at times, the subject matter is often dark and the laughs are few and far between. These people probably went in expecting Superbad mixed with some of the fart gags from Step Brothers. For me though, this marks the start of something big for Jay and Mark Duplass.",True
"Very Sweet.Dogfight, starring River Phoenix and Lili Taylor, is a surprisingly charming film. It tells a love story born of peculiar circumstances, much like Marty starring Ernest Borgnine. Phoenix and Taylor are quiet and awkward people on seemingly different paths who spend a short time together and wind up falling deeply in love with one another. The film is set against the backdrop of the autumn of 1963, prior to immense change in the United States. It is an intelligent work with a keen visual sensewatch for a kissing scene where our leads practically become musicbox dancersand fine acting.",False
"I work on the 19th floor. Ordinary Policy Department, Premium Accounting Division, Section W, desk number 861In the beginning of The Apartment we see C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) being lost in a sea of desks within a gigantic office room. He works for a huge New York insurance company employing over thirty thousand souls spread over twentyseven floors. Sometimes he is working overtime; Its not like I was overly ambitious... Baxter tells us defensively. You see, I have this little problem with my apartment I cant always get in when I want to. The reason are several superiors, to whom he is lending his apartment for their extramarital escapades. In exchange they promise to give his career a push by passing recommendations to the personnel manager, Mr. Sheldrake (Fred Mac Murray). Although Buddy Boy (thats his disrespectful yet firmly established nickname) is daily surrounded by hundreds of people, he is drowning in lonesomeness. Apart from his mocking colleagues, there does not seem to be any family or close friends. In fact, the only decent person among his acquaintances is his neighbour, Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen), ironically under the wrong impression that the man next door is a womanizing drunkard. So Baxter meekly adapts to the mercilessness of corporate life, putting all hopes of happiness into his career. His free evenings consist of watching TV, preparing dinner or cleaning up after the occupants of his apartment. Yes, one could say that Baxter does not exactly lead a joyful life. Yet, there is something, or rather somebody carrying light into the loners gloominess when he falls in love with the pretty elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley Mac Laine). Although Fran likes him for his decency and kindness, she does not quite share the feelings of her ardent admirer. But Buddy Boy refuses to notice any signs of unrequited love and eventually talks her into going out with him. You can imagine how Baxter feels when she fails to turn up, and how things get significantly worse when he finds out that she is actually having intimate meetings with the personnel manager Mr. Sheldrake in HIS apartment. The image of purity Baxter had of Fran is gone. On Christmas Eve, he decides to drown his broken heart in a bar while his apartment is occupied by the cause of his misery. But Fran doesnt feel any happier than Baxter, and with the depressing effect Christmas can have on the lonesome and desperate, the story threatens to take a turn into tragedy... It is hard to pin The Apartment on a single genre. The sharp, witty dialogue as well as Jack Lemmons hilarious mimic would hint at a romantic comedy. Yet, one cannot overlook the tragic elements which let us dive into thoughtfulness, but never too deeply. Then again the film works on a satiric level, operating as cynical social commentary on corporate culture in the sixties (which is not very unlike todays business life). The remarkable thing about this film is that these three qualities merge perfectly into each other without ever losing the balance. The Apartment is a most entertaining picture, sometimes rushing from one hilarity to the next, and then suddenly slowing down to leave room for contemplation. Sometimes uplifting, sometimes depressing, sometimes both at the same time. Billy Wilder mixed these contrary moods, and most amazingly, it worked out just fine. First and foremost The Apartment deals with loneliness and the everlasting search for unaccomplished love. I used to live like Robinson Crusoe. I mean shipwrecked among 8 million people. And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you were. Baxter tells Ms Kubelik. Does any relationship ever work out the way one dreamed it would? Additionally the film points out how people let themselves be treated badly out of total lack of selfesteem. Standing up for oneself and saying the simple word no can sometimes be an art of its own. As an able filmmaker and scriptwriter (together with I. A. L. Diamond, Some like it Hot), Billy Wilder once again produced a film classic of outstanding quality. I have yet to see another picture, equally consistent at providing such humorous and welltimed dialogues. The amount of memorable quotes is remarkable and the entire cast did a terrific job at delivering them. Moreover, Wilder chose to shoot in black and white widescreen, shining with beautiful cinematography, and thereby gave the film a very special melancholy mood. Maybe the greatest strength of The Apartment is its honesty. It doesnt lie to us by painting images of perfect love or of perfect people. Neither does it create scenarios of utter hopelessness. However, it shows us that although life can be unfair on default, everyone is responsible for oneself to work up the courage to achieve happiness. With the directors cynical, yet comic approach to life, the film takes itself serious and it doesnt. It lets us taste the bitter and the sweet, thereby lending itself a tone of reality. For that reason alone I dont feel cheated by The Apartment and its story never failed to cheer me up. Then again, I may be too much of a pessimistic optimist.",True
"Superb acting skills This film is about a young first year Harvard students life with depression and personality problems.Christina Riccis acting is superb in this film. She plays Lizzie very well, she manages to give a full range of emotional expressions. Most of the time, Lizzies sad, so Christina Ricci had to pull a sad face most of the time. In addition to sadness, there is also joy, ecstasy, intoxication, rage and jealousy. All these emotions are fully and effectively displayed by Ricci.Jessica Lange acts very well in this film as well. She plays this overcontrolling mother with a lot of anger. The scene with her arguing about the medical bills with Christina Ricci is amazing, they both displays brilliant acting skills.The film is not bad at all, it was a pity that it did not receive a theatrical release.",True
"Rare film that ventures into Good and Evil Conscience Lets begin by declaring that you do not need to be a Woody Allen fan to appreciate this film. As is often the case, Allens schlemiel character is the least sympathetic and interesting one in the movie.But that aside, heres a story that I found thoroughly engaging. Is there a perfect crime? Is guilt the same as remorse? How does a good person come to terms with his sins? The blind Rabbi: Is God unseeing? The Holocaust survivor philosopher who challenges survival (thats all I can say without spoiling): is there any real redemption?The movie has flaws but I give it a 10 for daring to ask serious questions. (And the visit to the old house in Brooklyn has a dynamism that all of us who remember our childhood homes will relate to.)",False
"Sweet, light weight musical  enjoy it (its later than you think!)In an old fashioned musical, the loves and losses of an extended upperclass family in Manhattan are followed in song from NY to Paris and Venice.The company logo comes onscreen followed closely by the white title on a black background.  Seconds later we are into the first song as two young lovers walk in the park  and its not until 100 minutes later that it lets you go again.  The plot is nothing more than lots of strands of love and loss tied together by family connections.  None of the stories really have any great significance but are backed up by wit and some charming song and dance numbers.  This is whimsy at its very best.It feels like Woody Allen has really relaxed and is making films that hark back to an older age  indeed his usual style is tuned down a little to make it more accessible and more enjoyable.  He has several black characters, his humour is witty but less cruel than usual and his narrative is driven by a teenage girl rather than himself.  It feels so free of his usual cynicism that it adds to the weightless charm it already has.  He handles the song and dance scene with such vigour and such imagination that you find yourself wondering why he hasnt done a musical before.The superb cast all catch the charm and light feel perfectly.  Not all of them are great singers but they all do well and give their best (except Barrymore who refused and was dubbed).  The usual stars are complimented by plenty of well known faces  Alda, Goldie Hawn, Lucas Haas, Portman, Tim Roth, Roberts and of course the wonderful Edward Norton.This is  100 minutes of lightweight wonder.  It has no rough edges, no difficult issues, no cruel jokes and very little swearing.  Only the coldest heart could fail to warm to this little charmer.",True
"Fantastic!If not the best sciencefiction film ever made, Jerome Bixbys Man From Earth is certainly one of the most thoughtful. This movie reminds me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Not with spaceships and effects, but with intelligent characters and exceptional dialogue, and that it left me with a sense of true wonder and joy, long after the credits ended. If the movie had been two hours longer I still would not have been bored, even though most of the film takes place in one small room. Its like watching a ninety minute Twilight Zone, with a perfect surprise ending. John Billingsly stands out, as does David Lee Smith, who may or may not be a caveman. The rest of the cast is good, but the script is the true star. And to anyone claiming this film is boring because we never leave the one room; Some of the very best Twilight Zones were just that. Good actors, good scripts, one or two locations. To anyone whos fed up with spaceships and explosions and Jar Jar Binks, see this movie as a reminder of what science fiction has always been about.",True
"With A Message To The Marketing People.A few months ago I put my name down for a preview of I Love You Phillip Morris I RSVP with plenty of time but the day before the screening I was called and informed that they had overbooked so I was dropped off. Strange I thought because some people I know had RSV Pd much later than me and they were included in the screening. Why? Because I was born in 1940 and the other were people in their 30s. One of them took me has his guest and surprise, surprise I was the one who loved the movie and has become since then a promoter of the film, so much so that people call me, me! to ask me Do you know when it will be released? I have to tell the marketing experts that they got the age thing completely wrong and discrimination of this kind doesnt serve the film very well at all. Now, that out of the way, let me talk about this extraordinary film. A true story no less. A conman searching for love and a romance like no other. Jim Carrey is superb and I bet that, if producers and distributors resolve their nonsense, hell be a strong contender at the Oscars 2011. He injects his character with the kind of truth I hadnt seen before in a Jim Carrey performance. Much more than in Man On The Moon or The Truman Show The character allows him to be the great funny man that he is and at the same time there are layers and layers of new inedited brilliance. And if that wasnt enough, Ewan Mc Gregor! A masterful portrayal of someone finding love in the most unexpected man in the most unexpected place. The scene of them falling in love has become one of my favorites. Now, you marketing people, will you let me in next time?",True
"One Of The Funniest And Most Violent Action Films In Years Im going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. Im 42 years old, Im from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like Rambo, Die Hard, The Terminator and Robocop, I cant stand that watereddown nobloodnoswearing gutless kiddie fare that is being served as action these days. I know the real thing when I see it  we used to see it all the time back in the day  and I hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. Kingsman: The Secret Service was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughns previous films, Layer Cake and Kick Ass, I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally badass, and I can now say thats actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of batshît crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an Rrated Bond might be like. I dont know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because Kingsman is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foulmouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of Men in Black and Mission Impossible thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what Game of Thrones is to Lord of the Rings: Where the former cant and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor  check. Bad language  check. Gratuitous violence  check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But its also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, overthetop fightscenes that in some instances even rival films like The Raid for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if youre as fed up with lame wannabe Die Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare John Wick or Equalizer, Kingsman seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies. If youre a film fan (especially of films that dont cater to teenagers), you might find it as enlightening as I have:www.thefanboyperspective.com/theimportanceoftherrating.html",False
"One of the years best films  thoughtprovoking and deeply moving. ***1/2 (out of four)AI  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:	AI  Artificial Intelligence is the hardest kind of movie to reviewbut its also the most enjoyable kind of movie to watch. Its been over three weeks since my screening of Steven Spielbergs emotionally harrowing epic about a robot boy.  Before writing my review, I wanted to let its themes, content, and characters sink into my head and make a solid impact. The film was based on an idea by Stanley Kubrick, but when he died in 1999, Speilberg took charge of the project. I could spend pages discussing the techniques of Kubricks intentions and Spielbergs decisions, but I will not. Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg are two of the greatest directors American cinema has to offer; its pure pleasure watching their ideas clash and flow.	 I am not going to examine each individual theme here, either. That would ruin the movie for you. AI  Artificial Intelligence presents many themes on screen, but its important to take what you get out of it. Whenever I read a review of Kubricks A Clockwork Orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey I feel influenced by the reviewers interpretation of the movies themes. Every time I watch either of those movies I get something new out of it. I hate it when other critics state the movies themes on paper as if its a fact. There is far too much room for interpretation to reveal this movies message, or the message of any Kubrick film for that matter. Ask 100 people, and you might get 100 different answers. AI  Artificial Intelligence is that kind of movieone of the years best.Critics and audiences alike have torn apart this movies endinga clear miscalculation by Spielberg. If Kubrick were in charge, the movie would have called it quits about twenty minutes earlier in an unsettling sequence that takes place in the ocean. But Speilberg, who always seems entranced by science fiction, injects an additional segment into the mix that does not work quite as well, but isnt so completely awful that it deserves such harsh criticism. It still leaves us with an open, startled emotional disorientation. I left the theater with tears in my eyes. The movie before the conclusion is so complex, moving, and involving in so many different ways the last twenty minutes didnt even come close to spoiling the movie for me.	AI transpires sometime in the near future after the polar ice caps have melted and flooded coastal cities and reduced natural resources. Mechanical androids have become popular since they require no commodities. Reproduction has also become highly illegal. Machines provide sexual services and if anyone wants a child, they will purchase a robot. However, the difference between a robot child and a living child is that robots cannot love. Thats the task professor Hobby (William Hurt) of Cybertronics Manufacturing has solved. He has made a robot child that can love. 	We can separate AI into two separate segments.  I do not want to reveal too much about each plot because the pleasure of watching this movie evolves from the revealing of the connecting plots. I will, however, briefly say the first details a robot childs interaction within a family, and the second deals with the robots estrangement from its family and the quest to regain the mothers love. I can imagine the material in Kubricks hands. The movies opening scene has a female robot begin to undress in a public office. Speilberg cuts the action before she reveals any explicit nudity. Kubrick would have had various shots of full frontal nudity. Spielberg, never comfortable with sexual material, leaves out much of the motivation behind Kubricks ideas. One of the biggest problems in AI is the lack of edge with the sexual content. Jude Law plays a robot gigolo who lives in a sex fantasy called Rouge City where people from everywhere come to seek sexual satisfaction. The central character, a robot boy played by Haley Joel Osment, motivates every action in the story except for the scenes in Rouge City. Why contain such a perverse character and setting when his entire existence simply displays a mood that has already been well established.  Obvious, the filmmakers toned the aspects of AI down to warrant a gutless PG13 ratingbut why? The movie isnt appropriate for children anyway, and its far too complex. Undoubtedly if Kubrick were in charge AI would have to be recut to avoid an NC17 rating. Spielberg should have either taken advantage of the perverse material or completely eliminated it.
	Here I am, doing exactly what I said that I wouldnt do, and at nearly 900 words, I still have not clearly expressed my own opinions on the film. I have many notes in front of my that display my reaction as I watched the film, but I am not going to use themthey reveal too much about the movie. AI is a very personal film, a deeply moving, scientific, careful, and harrowing motion picture that displays startling talent on screen and behind the scenes. The special effects are extraordinary. The performances are alarmingthe immensely talented Haley Joel Osment may once again be up for an Academy Award nomination. Go see the movie, then talk about it with others. Its the kind of film that you can spend hours thinking about, then go see it again.",False
"The Past In The Future.To begin, Looper is a scifi film set in the future, dealing with the implications of timetravel, although it is very much a film about the past. The film is all about the past, how it affects the present and the future and how it drives people with the majority of the film building characters and establishing plot.Anyone looking for an action film will be sorely disappointed because this is first and foremost a writers film, focusing on plot, character and dialogue. As mentioned above, the brunt of the film falls on development, more so than action setpieces and CGI. The portions of the city and the near future Johnson has created, whilst some may see as unoriginal, I see as tributary. A lawless country split socially in half, poverty on one side, excess on the other, the world Johnson has manufactured carries an air similar to that of Alfonso Cuarons Children of Men, a comparably important scifi film in the struggle to build the credibility of the genre in the realm of modern cinema.Not only is the film intelligent, it also acts as a courier for Johnson, a director of hit (Brick) and miss (The Brothers Bloom) repute following his sophomore outing. If you support intelligent science fiction in the intellectual vein of Inception and Primer, Looper is a film sitting firmly in the middle of the two. Break the box office with this film and bring intelligence back to filmmaking.",True
"Very eerie, very disturbing, very nightmareish and very entertaining!I absolutely loved this movie. I have always loved to watch a good flick that puts my brain to the test. Maybe the film isnt suppose to make much sense, but thats what I love about it. You have to try and analyze it and make your own theories about what just took place. This movie isnt for a lot of people and I mean a lot. You have to like movies like Mulholland Drive, Memento, The Man Who Wasnt There, etc.. to even begin to like this one. Im not necessarily a big David Lynch fan, but this movie rocked big time.     One of the most eery parts of the film is when (Bill Pullman) is making love to his wife (Patricia Arquette) and her face turns into the mystery man (Robert Blake). A very freaky looking individual, indeed. In my eyes, he represents the devil. But, thats my take on it.     Another great scene is when Pete is making love to Patricia Arquette in the Desert. The lighting, music, camera angles, emotions and everything is just one of the best pieces of cinemtography Ive ever seen in my life.      My recommendation is this: If you liked Mulholland Drive, Memento, Pulp Fiction, Fargo, The Man Who Wasnt There, Blue Velvet, then this movie is your cup of tea. If not, dont waste your time, cause youll hate it, more than likely. 3 1/2 *s out of 4 *s.",True

If you think Micheal Douglas is an over rated actor then this movie is enough to prove you wrong. Sean Penn does full justice to his cameo. This is not a movie that leaves you with puzzles after watching unlike many mystery thrillers, instead it solves itself and relaxes your muscles after a rough ride. This is a movie with an engrossing script, excellent acting and flawless direction. If you have not watched this movie yet then PLAY it. You wont regret it all. Entertainment at its best.

"Unremarkable, yet enjoyable slice of 70s cool.(66%) A very convincing in terms of period detail crime drama featuring a solid cast and a decent character based story that satisfies through its toe tapping soundtrack. Clive Owen has a truly fine onscreen presence and hes really great in this, and because he and everyone else are also good, along with the few nice bits of gripping and intense action, meaning that the undebatable flaws in the script, and a couple of minor issues here and there dont really matter that much. This will likely get seen by about half as many people than it deserves, but despite that, and for Mr Clive Owen especially, this is worth a very nostalgic trip to the cinema.",False
"I predict you wont be miserable.Manhattan still drives Woody Allen crazy: Urbanites are prey to ambition and lust, pride and diffidence and even sound like Woody with their halting sentences, paranoid affectations, and occasionally witty lines tossed off like the dregs of their grande lattes. Its a petting zoo of needy moderns who most of all want to find love, which eludes them right up to the last cliffhanging moment.Alvy Singer and Annie Hall are the best known of Allens angstridden city dwellers, but the new Woodies are every bit as screwed up if not more knowing about the quagmires their marriages and professions have become. The setup is twin parallel stories starting from the same incident reflecting separately the tragic and the comic possibilities.It all begins with a discussion at a restaurant table among four sophisticates about life being either tragic or comic. Sy (Wallace Shawn), a comedy writer, argues that people need laughter to overcome lifes essential pain (difficult to separate Shawn from the memory of his discussion in My Dinner with Andre). Max (Larry Pine) says that life is absurd and therefore tragic. So each tells the same story differently about an uninvited guest, one story a romantic comedy, the other a tragic tale of a desperate loner.Will Farrell as a neurotic husband does the best fax Allen yet in his films. His lines are vintage Woody, tossedoff selfdeprecation with a worldly wise guy subtext. One of the best lines comes from Susan (Amanda Peet), a director, who discloses the title of her newest film, The Castration Sonata, putting male sexuality in perspective. The Woodman returns in fine form to take on Aristotle and try to fulfill his own hope over a quarter century ago when he said, If my film makes one more person miserable, Ill feel Ive done my job. His tragedy has such ample comedy, I predict you wont be miserable.",True
"Wars do not win by evacuation, but in this very salvation there is a victory © Dunkirk A talented boy named Christopher was not indifferent to cinema since childhood. His first homemovie he tried to shoot, barely ten years old, armed with his fathers 8millimeter camera. The main roles in the first movies of a small fan of the Star Wars were played by the toy soldiers donated by the father (unfortunately, the permanent companion of Christophers film career, Michael Kane, at that time was intercepted by Richard Attenborough for filming in another war movie). Almost 30 years of persistent directorial work. 9 fulllength films, each of which is not familiar with the rental fiasco. Total fees of more than $ 4 billion for all work and a loud name. In the age of glory sin can not remember youth? And so, in the jubilee project, Dunkirk  Christopher Nolan returns to his first directors experience  military history. Only soldiers this time  not a toy.Taking your favorite 70millimeter film, a lot of natural scenery (minimum digital recording and green screens, gentlemen, only old school), loyal comrades (Zimmer, Van Hiteim, Crowley, Smith), and got several working Spitfires and Messerschmitt, Christopher says: I want to shoot a visually beautiful movie. And in Dunkirk he did it in his corporate style  with the inherent color effects a la The Dark Knight, the epic scenes of air battles, the sinking of ships and the endless bombing that look no less qualitative than the fall of Cooper in Gargantua or a scene with a wave in Interstellar. But this was clearly not enough. And Christopher Nolan proclaimed: More realism!. Operator Hoyte Van Hoytem should not be repeated twice. He unhooked a 100kilogram IMAX 3D camera from a suspended tripod and, in an oldfashioned way, took off all the ground scenes from his shoulder. Voila, Dunkirk becomes the first film where IMAX shooting was done by hand  the work received a lot of realistic scenes from the face of desperate British troops, filled with panic, Nolan confirmed the title of experimental filmmaker, and Van Hoite moderately missed the gym . Ideally.Dunkirk is a screen reproduction of the famous in the history of Great Britain operation Dynamo. In 1940, nearly 400,000 discouraged allies (mostly British) were pushed back by the German army to the small French port city of Dunkirk, on the English Channel. In conditions of total economy of military resources, involving civil courts, Great Britain begins the largest rescue operation. Christopher Nolan offers us his vision of these events and gives us a chance to look at them from three angles. Firstly, from the air  on behalf of the pilots of the Royal Air Force, at all times seeking through the strait to help their associates. Secondly, from the sea  on behalf of the crew of a small civilian ship, which is also sent to Dunkirk to assist in the evacuation of the British corps. And, thirdly, on behalf of desperate soldiers, who are eager to survive and get home, at any cost.
Christopher Nolan, in spite of his fears, was inspired not by the Spielberg story of the salvation of Private Ryan and not even by Stouns Platoon, but (!) Nonstop action  Speed and Unmanaged. The genre of Dunkirk smoothly balances between the vigorous thriller and worthy warmovie, and the suspense  just off scale. In addition, the director immerses us in a nonlinear narrative, saturated with flashbacks and endless action in the spirit of the film Remember. We can observe the picture of the bombing of the shore from the land, and in a few minutes  the same scene, but already from the fuselage of the Spitfire.A few words about music. Oh, the seventh was scorching. Hans Zimmer, are you human? From the very first minutes, the soundtrack began, which did not end at all until the final credits, alternating only its tempo. Due to this, Dunkirk looks in one breath, in the truest sense of the word. I do not want to go into a detailed description of the impressions  I just wait for Zimmers music to be called the classics of the 21st century.But fans of the deep Nolan story are waiting for the sad news. In Dunkirk the director, not wishing to go beyond the historical framework, relied on reliability and coverage. There is a minimum of metaphoricality, a minimum of a unique fantasy, a minimum of understatement with respect to the plot and a maximum of understatement with respect to the characters. Calling the main character (Finn Whitehead) by the name Tommy (if we collectively called the Germans Fritzes, the Germans generally called the British Tommies), Nolan seems to seek to generalize and project on his fate and feelings the experiences of all who was in this situation  to create the effect of an impersonal mass. All this reminded me madly Remarque and his On the Western Front without Change  a real war, without superheroes (and was it not for this that the eminent cast was slightly overshadowed?), Impregnated with despair, a thirst for survival and whistling bullets from an invisible enemy.Caesar could simultaneously read one text and dictate another. Walter White  at the same time teach chemistry and cook meth. Well, and Christopher Nolan damn well knows how to combine the position of a talented screenwriter and an unrivaled director. And, perhaps, he once again proved it.
Dunkirk is the tenth, anniversary work of Christopher Nolan. Powerful historical film with an invigorating suspense and dizzying visualization. A minimum of digital effects, a maximum of material props and cardboard decorations  a balm for the soul for all fans of the old school of cinema. Unfortunately (or not), the genius of the play played to the detriment of the uniqueness of the script  the fans of Beginning, Prestige and Interstellar will definitely wait for some disappointment. In all other respects, the signature handwriting of the master of a largescale movie is felt in every minute of the timekeeping.You will like this movie, ladies and gentlemen, rest assured. Enjoy watching!",True
"Unbroken I cannot understand the negative reviews of this movie ,are the themes of bravery,endurance and forgiveness outdated?It is well known that the regeime of Japanese prison camps was cruel to say the least.The acting of the lead players was faultless proving again that British and Irish actors can play the roles of Americans.I found the movie moving, inspirational. Yes it was violent but not gratious. Ms Jolie is to be congratulated on her directing. One question did the leads fast for their roles or was CGI used to give the impression of their skeletal frames.The ariel dog fights did use use computer enhancement as did the plane crash.I found this movie much more watchable than the much praised American Sniper",False
"Definitely worth seeing for two amazing performances from Downey and Duvall.I saw this film twice at TIFF and was quite impressed! Its getting some harsh reviews, undeservedly. Yes, its too long and yes, director David Dobkin needs to work on his tone and pacing, but the story is great and the performances are fantastic! Not a simple courtroom drama at all, the story is more about Hank Palmer (Downey)s struggle to understand his relationship with his father and to accept where he came from. Its about identity, family, and all the messiness and contradictions of life. If you are a teenager who cant sit still through a morethantwohours long movie, or expect some type of John Grisham or Iron Manlike action from this film, you will be disappointed. If you are a true film lover who revels in watching great actors practice their craft, you will not be disappointed by The Judge. This movie is definitely worth sitting through for amazing performances by both Downey and Duvall, who could both be up for Oscar nominations for their roles as the son and father, respectively. There are many very funny moments as well as many touching moments between father and son, brother and brother. The audience I sat with at Roy Thomson Hall loved it, frequently expressing their appreciation with laughter. See for yourself on October 10dont let a few critics spoil it for you.",False
"Soderbergh Does Drugs and Does Them Well Side Effects is a psychological thriller centered around the pharmaceutical industry. I wont say much more for fear of spoiling anything, but lets just say an experimental drug prescription goes... haywire. ;)Steven Soderbergh crafts his suspense from the very first frame with a perfect start for the film. The plot then pulls us in and keeps us guessing as the mystery slowly unfolds. The cast meshes wonderfully. Jude Law delivers a strong lead as the frustrated psychiatrist and Rooney Mara is mysterious and unpredictable. My only complaint is the performances were not as dramatic as they could have been. Mara was excellent at portraying her characters cold and lifeless depression, but I have seen what she is really capable of (Finchers The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), and she could have definitely reached those heights with this type of character. Nonetheless, a fine set of performances all around, but they take a back seat to the intoxicating narrative.So is Side Effects Soderberghs last hurrah? I certainly hope not, as its probably my favorite film of his. I do wish Soderbergh got more range out of Mara, but the result is a satisfying and expertlywoven psychological drama packed with twists and turns.",True
"Lock, Stock, and Many Smoking Barrels The release of Tarantinos Pulp Fiction in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks  serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress  were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius stripstyle plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantinos success, but it wasnt until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasnt a fluke.Turkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when hes not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O Neil, a mumbling manic motormouthed piker who also happens to be a onepunch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a fourfingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you arent confused yet, you soon will be.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Mr. Madonnas (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a noname cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel Snatch is stylistically very similar to Lock, Stock:  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think Very Bad Things).  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.
Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages  each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out:  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes coldblooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however, I would have to go with Brad Pitt Pitt resurrects his trailer trash look from Kalifornia and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friends Uncle Wally on a bad day.  As Mickey O Neil, the hard drinking wily grifter and parttime pugilist, Pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor.  And I would be remiss if I didnt mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.While Snatch initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to Ritchies earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own.",True
"Wonderful Effort From First Time Writer/Director Zack Braff I really loved this movie.  I mean, really.  So it surprised me to come here and find it rated so low.By no means is this a perfect movie.  It can be slow or awkward from time to time and there are one or two moments that just dont work.  But.  By and large I was really impressed.Its a great little story with just the right balance of comedy and drama, full of quirky characters and interesting performances.  Ian Holm demands attention, as always, and Natalie Portmans Sam, while offputting at first, definitely grew on me as she grew into a real character.
But the real story here is Zack Braff.  It should surprise no one who has ever watched Scrubs that his performance keeps the movie together; or that he is able to create a jokey, distant, somewhat sarcastic character who also elicits real empathy from the audience and manages to emanate deep wounds. What amazes me is the work he has done here as a first time writer/director.
First off, there is an actual narrative here with meaning and relevance. Too often, the big Hollywood movies will have a plot that resolves itself, but means nothing; on the flip side, independent movies almost seem to disdain plot for mood and thematic concerns.  Braff is able to weave both togethera difficult task for a young writer.  The dialogue is witty, plot situations intelligent and creative, and overall the writing is justgood.As for his directing, there are a few odd choices.  Im still not sure I like one scene the main characters are screaming into a deep ravine and the camera sweeps away into said ravine.  It just tossed me out of the movie a bit.  Im also not completely sure what to make of the movies ending, which I wont go into further except to say that I felt it almost changed the focus of the movie up to that point and made it about something else. However, there are moments of absolutely beauty as well, here.  The entire scene where Sam and Andrew talk in his friends pool has some great shots, and Braffs comedic flair and timing are evident in his directing style, which still manages to pull back for the more dramatic and poignant moments.I urge you to see this movie.  Its not a big movie.  It was never meant to be.  But I have little doubt that, once it finds an audience, it will be remembered for years to come.  Sort of a modern day Graduate with a more hopeful outlook on life.",False
"Warning to readers of reviews of Disappearance...Apparently different versions exist. This IM Db site lists the running time as a little over two hours, but the version I saw was listed at well over three hours. It was very long, basically two movies back to back. Many of the scenes were shown twice, from the perspective of the two principals, with differences that were sometimes striking and sometimes very subtle. I found it fascinating, but I can imagine that some viewers will become impatient. (My bladder did  dont go into this one with a large Coke.) I would like to see it again on video so I can go back and forth and compare versions of events, but I am worried that Ill end up renting a shorter version. The existence of different versions makes it a moving target  its difficult to review, and even more difficult for a prospective viewer to evaluate on the basis of published reviews, if you dont know which version the reviewer saw. They say the difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is three days. Well, the difference between a good movie and a bad movie may be as little as three minutes, edited out or left in.Im giving this movie 9 stars because of a single line of dialog that blew me away and changed my perception of a lot of experiences in my own life. You cant ask for more than that from a movie. Its a comment made by one of the minor characters (the waitress)  almost a throwaway line, really  about the effect that people have on each other in relationships. I dont even know if it is included in the shorter version of the movie.",False
"Another great gangster drama only this time with lessons...A father(Robert De Niro) who stresses the importance of honest work, teaches his son values in 1960s New York as a distrusting mobster(Chazz Palminteri) also shares his perspective and becomes some what of a father figure to the kid. Faced with racism and a crimebased community, learns his own morals from a strand of tough events.This is not the first movie I have ever seen to make the gangster out to be a some what nice guy. But this is the first one I have seen to actually make him somewhat of a saint. Sonny(Palminteri) is the example of a split personality with a criminal. He is very tough with a community that he loves and basically runs but is also very protective and guiding to many people. I found this to be quite interesting in this type of genre.Robert De Niros character on the other hand, is very bold. He plays the father who is concerned with his sons well being and is just your normal flat character. He was unimpressive, but effective for a movie that was by no means perfect in the first place.The idea of this movie was what made it so intriguing. At two hours long, it consists of a large epic story of a young man trying to make it through a part of New York. Some important events were perhaps too close together but it was still entertaining and quite moving. Overall, A Bronx Tale is a fine experience of cinema with a wonderful story.I highly recommend this movie.",True
"Beautiful, moving, intense I havent seen a genuinely emotional, smart, nonmanipulative, heart felt drama in a loooong time. Brie Larson deservedly won an Oscar for her performance in this, but Room shouldve swept the board in every category.The film centres on a Mother and her five year old son, living inside just four walls, and it slowly transpires that she has been held captive for seven years, and had a child by her kidnapper. She creates a world for her son within their confines, not telling him the truth about their situation and whats outside until hes old enough to understand. After failed escape attempts in the past, but now with the help of her son, she gives freedom another try.There were moments in Room that were so intense that I barely breathed. It never feels inauthentic, and thanks to incredible acting, its always believable. If you want a straightup thriller of bad guy commits crime, bad guy gets comeuppance, youll be disappointed. This is about human resilience, the bond between Mother and child, selflessness, and finding your place in the world after having your understanding of it flipped upside down.",True

"Cinematic excellence I havent seen too many Oliver Stone pictures; JFK, Scarface(which he wrote, not directed), and this one. I dont know too much about his directorial style, but if any of his other films are like this one, Ill have to watch more of them. The visual style is amazing. The whole film has sort of a psychedelic visual style, and utilizes constant cuts and constant change in color scheme, often changing between powerful green, blue, red and even black/white. Of course, none of this is random. Its there to project symbolism and keep the mood intense and constantly evolving, and, believe me, it works perfectly. With many references to popular media(television, mainly), demons and the desensitizing effect of television. The effect of half of the imagery being seen through a television screen or hallucinated is amazing. The film is experimental and psychological. As Stone puts it in the documentary, its a film about two people breaking the rules, so its only fitting that the filmmakers are also breaking the rules. Its chaotic and wild, insane and mentally exhausting. Its a film about pain, violence and giving in to cravings and desires. But it in no way romanticizes the aforementioned three points. Quite the opposite. I believe someone once told me that the film makes killing and violence look appealing. I cant even explain how wrong that is. This truly is an amazing film. If you can sit through this, and you (honestly) think of yourself as perceptive and intelligent, you have to see this movie. Its not just recommended or a good idea to watch, its mandatory for anyone that get it. The plot is great and wellpaced. Its never boring. The acting is great. The characters are wellwritten, credible and so easy to understand and sympathize with that many will hate the film for it. The whole film is amazing on so many levels. I recommend it to any person who believes himself or herself to be hardened and intelligent enough to sit through it, and, more importantly, understand it. I recommend you get the directors cut, as it keeps everything that the other released version cut off. Highly recommendable. 10/10",True
"1930s Chicago Revisited in Style Eighty years after the events, Michael Mann takes on the Period Chicago Gangster genre, and wins, with this entertaining story. Do not be put off by some churlish carping from the critics, much of which is generated by the very high standards that Manns films are now judged. The lengthy 140 minute running time flies by leaving the audience wondering about what could have been added to the story, not what should have been omitted.Essentially this is the story of the life, in his heyday, and death of Gangster John Dillinger. It bounces along, leaving little room for back story or leisurely character development, like Dillinger,it lives for the moment. Johhny Depp is superb as Dillinger, Christian Bale a thoroughly convincing Melvin Purvis, his taciturn but determined G Man nemesis.A plot curio is that some time is given over to J Edgar Hoovers fight to establish an FBI with Purvis operating as his local enforcer.But the role is under developed, it could be dropped with no impact on the plot, making you wonder how much extra footage was left on the cutting room floor, hopefully set for an appearance on the DVD.Marion Cotillard, a native Frenchwoman, plays the part of the leading lady, and Dillingers love interest, well enough. In a role which offers infrequent appearances, she conforms to the genre requirements of being easily bedded, hit, and cries on demand.Critics have queried the way that the digital film is shot.There is none of the lushness of last of the Mohicans, nor the grittiness of Collateral, but the compelling plot leaves little time to worry about that.Review audiences also complained of poor sound quality and mumbled dialogue, not faults that I could identify with on this showing.The showdown between Dillinger and Purvis happens early on, in a scene which is played straight and without lingering fanfare, it is certainly no rerun of De Niro v Pacino in Heat.If the film lacks anything it is a sense of Tragedy, so wonderfully apparent in De Palmas Carlitos Way. Depp and Purvis are played so ruthlessly and efficiently by Depp and Bale that pathos and emotional attachment are on pretty short display.The period is lovingly recreated by Mann and the action sequences, unsurprisingly, never fail to disappoint, indeed when Dillinger is first shown robbing a bank his vault over the counter is seen in graceful slow motion. Diana Krall has a pleasing cameo as a nightclub torch singer performing Bye Bye Blackbird and the costumes are a consistent delight.Punchy, light on its feet and offering weighty roles for Depp and Bale, this will be enjoyed by ardent fans and the curious alike.",False
"Powerful and meaningful if youve been there Theres a serious polarity in the reviews for this film,and Im not surprised. If youve ever suffered depression this bleak movie will hit hard, and youll pick up on all of the subtle messages it sends out. Its done so well it cant be anything other than achingly familiar. The despondency, and the frustration the sufferer feels at their own despondency, in particular, is well conveyed. Unfortunately I think a large chunk of the people whove seen this film (and there arent many who have, sadly) went to it expecting a slightly arty apocalypse movie. Its not a smarter Deep Impact. The (blue) planet Melancholia is just a metaphor for depression. Unrelenting and irresistible, Melancholia has the main character in its thrall.For those who dont get this movie, no its not a pretentious, pseudo intellectual flick. Rather its a well crafted take on the fine detail of a subject matter that you have been fortunate enough to not have had to understand. Long may that be the case.",True
"Healing and Cathartic Oh, I better come out and say it: I love Terrence Malick. I think hes one of the few filmmakers who has completely and utterly captured filmic form. The Thin Red Line was, to me, an astonishing experience; beautiful, horrific and the best movie of the 90s. Badlands is the best loversonthelam movie Ive ever seen (it certainly makes True Romance look like a gimmicky fraud of a movie). Malick somehow manages to make everything seem painfully beautiful: his landscape, his actors, his dialogue. Theres something always elegiac about his movies.
Theres a picture of James Dean I saw from his youth  a baseball team photo  and the caption said something about how it captured his face, and in it, wisdom and sadness far beyond his years. Thats what Malick does in his films and particularly in this film.He must have been a fan of James Dean (probably one of the reasons he chose to make Badlands, as a sort of homage), but not in the sense that coolness comes from a perfectly combed coiffure, a red leather jacket (which it wasnt  it was a windbreaker) and a dark brood. Theres a similar story here to that of Giant, set on a farm with that remarkable house, two men and one girl. Only Giant didnt have a philosophizing and very strange little girl. It was also an overblown soap opera and while this film is, I guess, a melodrama, it certainly isnt melodramatic.If Malick is anyone in the film, hes Sam Shapard; watching his love through a lens. Malick uses Manz as a sort of channel. If this is indeed some fashion of his own story, Malick tells us through her, with he visualized by Shepard, which is a somewhat brilliant approach. Manz is strangely philosophical; at once blunt and abstract. The story is obviously centered around her  I dont see why this wouldnt be obvious  but shes pushed into the background, commenting on the characters and informing us like God from above.As always with Malick, his film is mesmerizing and hypnotic. I was surprised that the film was only a little over an hourandahalf. The great Ennio Morricone created a wonderful score for this film that seems to forebode impending doom. Unlike his more famous spaghetti western scores, its never overlyflamboyant. And the cinematography, listed as belonging to Nestor Almendros, but wellknown to be at least substantially contributed to by Haskell Wexler, is so much like an oil painting that its just about liquid film. Id be willing to pay a lot of money to see this one on the big screen.It might seem obvious to state that this film is a transition between Badlands and The Thin Red Line, after all it was the middle film. But this film has moments, especially in the finale, that are surprisingly close to that of Badlands and this is the film where Malick fully mastered his approach of lush, visual poetry told at a languid pace that never seems boring, since youre fully within the film;s grasp.Pauline Kael said in her review that the film is an empty Christmas tree: you can hang all your dumb metaphors on it. And Charles Taylor, always following Kaels lead (even from beyond the grave), said of Malicks two 1970s films, Next to the work of Altman, Scorsese, Coppola, De Palma and Mazursky from that period, theyre pallid jokes.What never fails to get me furious is when someone viciously attacks a director, like Malick, for being selfindulgent. Of course its selfindulgent, hes telling a story that means something to him and trying to share what he feels with us. Malick certainly isnt trying to alienate people, and if you are alienated by his films, well, dont watch them. Malick is a filmmaker like Kubrick, but more fluid and much less abrasive. I mean, if youre going to aggressively attack a filmmaker, aggressively attack someone who is aggressive on his side. Directors like Malick use abstractions to engage their audiences more fully than most. By leaving things  often feelings  open to interpretation, the film becomes more intimate.Certainly one of the most enduring films from the 70s, this is a masterwork.****",True
"Ryan Cooglers impeccable writing and directing are phenomenal, and in the films final scenes, tears are guaranteed.In the wake of the many tragic shootings in the U.S., things have looked pretty bleak for Americans. Haunted by the Newtown school shooting, the Aurora theater shooting, as well as countless local and minor shootings, American lives have been turned upsidedown on numerous occasions. Somehow, one recent shooting almost seems to have been buried by the others. That shooting is the tragic death of Oakland citizen Oscar Grant on New Years Eve, 2008. Five years later, first time director Ryan Coogler brings this story back to the public eye with Fruitvale Station, a heartwrenching drama that is sure to leave you mistyeyed.Fruitvale Station ultimately opens with its ending. The tragedy unfolds with real footage recorded by witnesses on their cell phones during the event. Oscar and some of his friends are brutalized by Bay Area Rapid Transit police for getting into a fight on the subway. Oscar, supposedly resisting arrest, is pinned to the ground by an officer. He pulls what he believes is his taser, and pulls the trigger. A loud bang rings as the screen cuts to black.The film then rewinds, and proceeds to cover the 24 hours leading to the incident at Fruitvale station, the last 24 hours of Oscar Grants life. As Oscars remaining hours slowly dwindle down, the film delves into the background and life of Oscar, who lives with his girlfriend Sophina and their young daughter Tatiana. Oscars relationship with his mother, his history with marijuana, and his family life is studied before the heartwrenching incident unfolds on the fateful New Years Eve.Fruitvale Station retells the depressing true story with exhilarating emotion and tearjerking drama. Whats great about Fruitvale Station is the way that the script doesnt go out of its way to make Oscar a hero or an overly sympathetic protagonist. The film shows Oscar for what he was: a troubled young man who wanted to become a better one, but was held back by his past. The writing manages to accurately tell the story, but also adds in some important elements that never happened, foreshadowing the dramatic end.The films real strength is the passionate portrayal of Oscar Grant by upandcoming actor Michael B. Jordan. In his first leading role, Jordan hits it out of the park, portraying every aspect of Oscars personality with phenomenal passion. Hes charming and relatable, but also explosive when the situation calls for it. In what shouldve been an Oscar nominated role (no joke intended), Jordans performance cannot be summed up in words. The supporting cast is also strong, notably Melonie Diaz as Sophina and Oscar winner Octavia Spencer as Oscars mother, both of whom are memorable and emotionally stunning in their roles.For a movie with a first time director, Fruitvale Station is a triumph. Ryan Cooglers impeccable writing and directing are phenomenal, and in the films final scenes, tears are guaranteed. Michael B. Jordan puts up a performance that is sure to make him a star, while Melonie Diaz and Octavia Spencer back up the film extremely well. With all these elements combined together in one emotionally hardhitting package, they make Fruitvale Station one of the best movies of the year.",True
"malick wannabe misses mark I came to this film with no more knowledge of it than that many critics I trust raved about it. I was sorely disappointed, and my only explanation for the praise it received was that weve been force fed so many banal and unimaginative films from the movie mill in Hollywood that any break from it will be treated like a morsel to the starving. Problem is, while GW is indeed different from the crowd, it isnt particularly original.  In fact it reminds me of a vastly inferior Terry Malick film.  It attempts to be a poetic, non linear look at the lives of adolescents in a decaying small north Carolina town, and while beautiful (it is after all 35mm cinemascope), it falls flat, with gratuitous wackiness and nonsequitors.  Sometimes these poor kids are forced to spout stuff that sounds like it came from Sartre or Camus.  Other times they are allowed to talk like the kids they are. And the adults?  Most are ludicrously overthetop.  I felt tortured by the pretentiousness of this thing at 42 minutes, but sat through the other 40 hoping for a payoff.  There wasnt much of one.  I had no emotional connection to anyone in here because I didnt recognize them as real.  Whats worse is I really could have.  Some of the ideas and situations in here are rich in potential, though left unmined, unrealized. Terry Malicks version of this faux Malick film would have been much better.",False
"High Rises allegory of class divide gets lost in a dull montage of blood, sweat and blue paint Ben Wheatley is one of the most exciting British directors working today. His two best films are Kill List, a deeply disturbing horror/thriller about a tormented contract killer, and Sightseers, a black comedy about a troubled couple on their parochial, psychopathic honeymoon.Key to these films success are strong characters with interesting dynamics. Kill List begins almost like a domestic kitchensink drama centred on the failing relationship between Jay (Neil Maskell) and Shel (My Anna Burning), but it subsequently evolves, or rather devolves, into something dark, dank and horrible in a most unpredictable manner. Sightseers may be most commonly remembered for its scenes of outlandish violence, such as when Chris (Steve Oram) deliberately runs over a litterer in a fit of righteous anger. However, underneath the comic outbursts of gore is the poignant relationship between Chris and Tina (Alice Lowe), an oddball pair with a past of loneliness and insecurity.Having proved himself as a director of visceral horror and emotional substance, Ben Wheatley is the natural choice to direct J.G. Ballards High Rise, a Goldingesque tale of violent class war exploding within a brutalist tower block. The fragility of civilisation, and the primitive savagery that lurks beneath it, is a darkly fascinating subject that has made for excellent films and books, such as Threads, a devastating vision of post apocalyptic Britain, and William Goldings Lord of the Flies, which needs no introduction.High Rise does not brush shoulders with such works, for its allegory of class divide gets lost in a dull montage of blood, sweat and blue paint. Oh, and dancing air hostesses, for reasons that are, to put it politely, enigmatic.The focal characters – Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston), a measured, middle class doctor; Charlotte Melville (Sienna Miller), a sultry woman who serves as Laings gateway in to upper floors high culture; Richard Wilder (Luke Evans), a pugnaciously aspirational documentary maker; and Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons), the patrician architect who designed the building – are introduced well enough, but ultimately do not receive sufficient development.As the lead and perhaps most relatable character, we are in the body of Laing when he traverses the towers social scene, which he admits to not being very good at. Some may find him steely, but Laing has an affable reserve and high emotional intelligence. He isnt particularly interested in the petty oneupmanship that comes with climbing the social ladder, but he manages to deftly negotiate it anyway through his insouciant reserve that maintains peoples interest and disarms any potential enemies. Hiddleston, one of Britains hottest exports, is well cast here, he delivers the best performance of the film.However, after a competent introduction to society in the high rise, Laing and the others get lost in an incoherent narrative that favours aesthetics and absurdity over credible character interplay. It begins three months ahead of the main events, showing a blood spattered Laing roasting a dogs leg over a fire surrounded by dirt and detritus. After the introductory period of around thirty minutes, the film then charts what led to this repellent spectacle with a disjointed series of set pieces that give little sense of progression.Electrical problems are plaguing the building and resentment is brewing between the upper and lower floors, but the descent into nihilism just happens. Dogs are being drowned, Laings painting his apartment (and himself) like a total madman and the whole building becomes a rubbishstrewn nightmare – but theres no tension, no crescendo, no credibility and, curiously, no one who considers leaving! The worsening relations should have been more gradual and given much greater depth and meaning by the characters, their dialogue and their relationships. Instead, the main character covers himself in paint to communicate his increasingly aberrant state of mind, which appears to be an obvious metaphor for tribal decorations.High Rise fails as a film about primal savagery and particularly as a film about class. In Woody Allens Blue Jasmine, I cringed as Jasmine and her husband Hal, arrogant members of New York high society, barely contained their raging superiority complexes as they awkwardly condescended to Ginger (Jasmines sister) and Augie, a decidedly blue collar couple who wonder at Hal and Jasmines luxurious home. No such realist interplay is to be found in High Rise, because its characters are thinly drawn and it isnt rooted in reality, which is very much to its detriment.Towards the films end, there are moments in which Royal and his minions discuss the politics and future of the tower, with Royal remarking that the lower floors should be Balkanised, meaning that they should be fragmented and pitted against each other in a manner reminiscent of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. I liked the use of that phrase, there should have been a lot more of this in the script, more overt political manoeuvring rather than surrealist claptrap and brutalist 70s chic.Alas, Wheatleys High Rise is more concerned with aesthetics and the 1970s, which means theres more in the way of shagpile carpets, dodgy hair and the colour brown than developed characters, coherent narrative structure and sociopolitical substance.58%www.hawkensian.com",False
"To call it a sequel is a travesty This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  De Niro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.",True
"Clint Eastwood shows you why he still should be in FRONT of the camera With his performance Eastwood shows you why people like himself, Jack Nicholson, or Paul Newman only come around once in a lifetime. Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence, and hes pure dynamite in Gran Torino. Perhaps the poor box office results of hollywoody movies like Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, caused Eastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material to work with as Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, hes as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy weve all had on our blocks with the garbage door open, the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes, but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. Im not going to give the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hardnosed tough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge, youll love this movie!!",True
"A true original This film had the sad history of being blackballed in the United States due to the incident at Columbine...which is a real shame, because it is a treasure...written and directed by Troy Duffy, Boondocks is set in Boston...it is the story of fraternal twin Irish boys (Connor and Murphy Mc Manus) who work in a meat packing plant...when their friend, Doc, is being stiff armed by the Russian Mafia, the boys and their friends step in to help...and away we go! Two of the most interesting characters in the film are played by veteran actor William Dafoe, and a newcomer to the silver screen, David Della Rocco. Dafoes character is Paul Smecker, a gay FBI agent specializing in organized crime...Rocco plays an Italian Mafia package boy who is a close friend to the Irish brothers...the central theme of the film is the indifference of good men...Connor and Murphy are not indifferent, and after helping their friend, Doc, the two embark on a crusade to rid the streets of Boston of criminals...with the assistance of their comical and zany friend, Rocco...This film had positive elements on all sides...humor...a moral message...and incredible actors...you will no doubt find yourself repeating the many memorable quotes from the film...I am a woman, and not at all into your typical shoot em up guy films...this is not another one of those films...it has become an underground cult sensation...See it...you will not be disappointed!",False
"A Moment to Remember Rocks What can I say? its one of my favorite movies. It has everything: love, romance, action, sorrow, and happiness. hero & heroine of this film have wonderful chemistry together, and it shows. It makes you feel like you want to become a better person, and not be so selfish, selfcentered, and makes you realize that there more important things in life. This movie is so indescribable and unique.I have seen it many times. I will admit that I am a hopeless romantic and I love to watch these types of movies.

"A massive, formulaic disappointment, with a towering performance from Michael Shannon Having developed a morbid fascination with serial killers over the past few years, I was delighted to hear that Richard Kuklinski, one of the most prolific and emotionless mass murderers in history, was to be given the cinematic treatment. Not only was his story ripe for a juicy adaptation, but Michael Shannon, the most consistently mesmerising actor working in film today, was cast as the titular Iceman. Sadly, inexperienced director Ariel Vromen, who up to this point had only made two films Ive never heard of, has delivered a bythenumbers biopic; one that follows familiar genre conventions and whitewashes Kuklinskis story completely in favour of a formula that a mainstream audience can comfortably follow.After being impressed by his towering frame and generally intimidating nature, mob boss Roy De Meo (Ray Liotta), who is in the employ of the Gambino crime family, takes the young Richard Kuklinski under his wing. To get a feel for him, De Meo tells Kuklinski to kill at tramp in broad daylight, to which Kuklinski coldly obeys . Soon enough, Kuklinski is carrying out mob hits for De Meo, while telling his clueless wife Deborah (Winona Ryder) that he is in finance. He meets fellow contract killer Robert Mr. Freezy Prongay (Chris Evans), who teaches Kuklinski the benefits of using cyanide to carry out the murders, and then freezing the bodies to rule out a time of death. But with De Meo coming under pressure from his boss Leonard Marks (Robert Davi) for a drug deal gone wrong, Kuklinki finds himself and his family under threat.What might have been a fascinating insight into the inner workings of a sociopath, The Iceman is nothing more than your standard straightto DVD mobster movie. Completely ignoring Kuklinskis natural instinct for murder (he was a serial killer long before the mob approached him) and his reputation as a merciless and cruel man, beating and killing men for the slightest of reasons, Vromen even adds a family angle that is completely untrue. To give the lead character a bit of recognisable humanity, here he is portrayed as a loving family man, dedicated to his wife and kids as the mob close around him. In fact, in real life Kuklinski was an aggressive wifebeater; a tyrannical king of the household who regularly committed acts of physical and mental abuse on his family.Artistic license is a right that every filmmaker has when conducting a biopic, but when theres a complex and fascinating story to tell, however dubious some of Kuklinskis claims are (he claims to be responsible for the murder of Jimmy Hoffa), then why make such drastic changes if all youre doing is making your subject the same character seen a thousand times before? Shannon deserves better than that, and his unnerving performance is one of the few saving graces here, but his character is reduced to nothing more than a standard mobster, seduced by the lifestyle and cutting himself off from regular life. He was a cruel, savage monster, who disposed of some of his victims by having them eaten alive by rats (or so he claims), or in one incident, he allowed his victim time to pray to God to see if he would answer his prayers, before killing him (this scene is played out in the film with James Franco as the victim).Plot strands veer off path and are offered no resolution, making them completely redundant. Some are intriguing, such as Stephen Dorffs appearance as Kuklinskis imprisoned paedophile brother, who hints at Kuklinskis dark childhood and abuse. Others are not, such as De Meos righthand man Josh Rosenthal (David Schwimmer) who is given more screen time than necessary, only for the story to fizzle out into absolutely nothing, as does De Meo himself. Given a longer running time, a more experienced director, and ultimately more commitment to the source material (various books and recordings exist of Kukinski, the most popular being Philip Carlos book The Iceman: Confessions of a Mafia Contratc Killer and the TV movie The Iceman Tapes), this could have been highly engrossing cinema, instead its a crushing disappointment, saved only by Shannons imposing performance.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com",True
"Not Your Average Serial Killer Movie (And Thats a Good Thing)Zodiac may frustrate viewers who come to David Finchers latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hairraising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killers perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working for the San Francisco Chronicle at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work. He becomes fascinated by the case, and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause. Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based, and according to his accounts, he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after hed been cleared for lack of evidence. Other characters come and go. Robert Downey, Jr. does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the Chronicle who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaals putupon wife, who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances, many of them against the odds. Since this isnt a character driven movie, many of the characters remain undeveloped, but not, for once, to the detriment of the film. This story isnt about the people involved, but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga; once theyve served their purpose, Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically, a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.Parts of Zodiac are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential, and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Finchers other wellknown films, like Seven and Fight Club. But Zodiac is much more grown up than those films, and for an audience to enjoy it, it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples, recreating the scenes of murders, digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the pre CSI era, when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail, but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion, but the reallife end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination, and what a journey it is.Grade: A",True
"loved it!I hate to slam anyone who didnt like and enjoy this movie. They chose four of the very best actors who fit together like a glove. I found it to be exceptional acting. Although many of you might only watch a movie once and then give up I dont know how many times I have seen it. Each time I decide to turn it on, as I have it recorded in two rooms, I laugh from beginning to end. And, I wouldnt be surprised if some day we find out that parts of this are very true. I just heard last week that the government is looking into paranormal tactics. What a surprise. Could very well be that its just another one of our countrys secrets. Im just sorry I didnt know it was being shot in New Mexico as I am not too far from Roswell. I would have loved to have been there. I have searched and searched for the bloopers but cannot find them.

"A supernatural thriller with a great story!The great cast already hints at it, Fallen is a great movie.Best way to watch this movie is to not know too much about it. Just pick up the movie and let it surprise you. Its like Identity, the less you know about it, the better.Director Gregory Hoblit is a great and underrated director. He knows how to get the maximum out of everything. He also directed the movies Primal Fear and Frequency and much acclaimed television series episodes for Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law and NYPD Blue.Really great about the movie is the story by Nicholas Kazan (yes, indeed the son of...). Its supernatural but it still knows how to remain believable and realistic. The viewer never knows what he is going to get and what will happen next. This is why it is best not to know too much about this movies story before viewing it for the first time.

"Its easy to dip into coffee and cigarettes and meet all the characters but you might get a bit bored by some of their conversations.In all honesty I just wanted to watch this movie to see Iggy Pop, Tom Waites, The White stripes and Bill Murray. I was tempted to fast forward all the other vignettes to get to the ones with these characters in but thankfully I never or I would never have seen cousins?  Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan playing themselves in an absolutely perfect portrayal of the shallow, sickening and repellent nature that comes with fame. Coogan takes the word scumbag to new heights, and Molinas keenness and almost innocence which slowly turns sour is perfectly pitched. Jarmusch has managed to capture the minutia of the trappings of fame so succinctly that sometimes its difficult to watch. Its excruciatingly embarrassing but just gorgeous and has to be seen  several times. Likewise with somewhere in California. Iggy and Tom play themselves but you can call Iggy Jim or Jimmy or Iggy or Jiggy if you like! Tom initially opts to call him Iggy but proceeds to refer to him as Jim throughout, and so the offkilter banter begins. Its an hilarious portrayal of two guys who obviously have a mutual respect for each others work but dont actually know each other that well. A series of ridiculous conversations and awkward silences ensue with Iggy becoming more and more animated and expressive to overcompensate for Toms laidback yet defensive attitude. There are some excellent oneliners and its just great watching these two giants chew the fat, fighting their different corners and trying to keep their cool. I also thought Cate Blanchett shone in cousins, playing both roles as bitter cousin/ insipid famous cousin. Its another awkward, horrible meeting between two people  one has made it, the other hasnt, and Its plain to see there isnt much love between them. We witness a series of underhand, loaded and nasty comments all in the guise of friendship, a friendship that only exists due to family ties. Coffee and cigarettes the movie is a bit like coffee and cigarettes the vice: youll get a buzz thats for sure. Its is an easy watch and each vignette has its qualities but as a whole its a bit of a cheeky movie. It gets off on the fact that it has all these fab artists starring in it which goes a long way but not far enough. But I cant stress enough that it really is worth getting this movie out for the Coogan/Molina and Pop/Waites vignettes. Both priceless and essential viewing.",True
"Over Half Century late than Fellinis 8 1/2 andmore clueless, goingnowhere pretentious. Trying so hard to find some unnecessary answers with a film to play out meaninglessly by a guy who miraculously relocated or misplaced himself in lot of bigdeal events or scenes, either looking up to the sky or jumped off from a pier into the sea for no obvious purpose but spurofthemoment childish behaviors, or entangled himself with some females in close contact, flesh against flesh, intimate but without profound romantic feelings at all, or woken by a sudden earthquake, moronically and aimlessly roamed around inside his room with bare feet littered with shattered glass, then when the aftershock tremors hit again, escaped downstairs, still without shoes, looked up to the sky, saw chopper passing, sirens....on and on, situated himself in desert, movie shooting locations, swimming pool, bed for no purpose. The old voice narration....then with some white hair guys mingled among younger ones....on and on, without any meaningful purpose. lot of wide angled nice scenes, sunsets.The whole movie failed to provide the viewers with any obvious intention but hollow camera works.

"Well Acted but Somewhat Empty Indie Drama I had been looking forward to seeing this new film directed by Sean Baker ever since reading the rave reviews for it that came out of Cannes and Toronto. While I can say that this film is beautifully filmed and features strong acting, it doesnt quite hit the mark. The film is about a poor young girl, raised by a single mother, and her friends who live in a rundown motel close to Disney World near Orlando, Florida. Baker uses a simple and lowkey filmmaking style to deliver excellent cinematography. The film has a strong and commanding color palette to its simple aesthetic. The performances on display in this movie are very satisfying for the most part. The child actors do a very good and convincing job, especially given their ages. Williem Dafoe is very good as the manager of the motel, although it would have been better if he had been given more of an emotional range to work with in his role throughout the movie. Unfortunately, the film does have some notable flaws. The tone of the movie is all over the place, with joyous childhood wonder juxtaposed sometimes abruptly with more edgy and mature themes. Such abrupt changes in tone and motif hold back the movies message to some degree. Some audiences will dislike that the movie is considerably darker than its trailers make it seem, although I was fine with that. The same concern over abrupt changes in tone is also evident in the movies writing, mixing puerile scatological jokes from the kids with more sophisticated and powerful material. Finally, the films final scene feels like a copout. Without giving anything away, the way it is done also makes one (unfortunately) wonder if it was filmed on impulse, or if the filmmakers ran out of budget.I really wanted to love The Florida Project, and its certainly not a bad film, but I just wish it could have been better. 6.5/10",True
"A lesson of how unique and quite fantastic minimalist cinema can be.A surprise at the 57th London Film Festival. A film where the whole story takes places inside the confines of a car, and with Tom Hardy as the oneman star. But just how well does it work?Tom Hardy, known best for majors roles in The Dark Knight Rises and Inception drops the theatricality and larger than life appearances and takes on the role of average man Ivan Locke, a building site manager, who over the past nine years has made his life as solid as the concrete he is in charge of pouring. Concrete is his religion. On the eve of the biggest job yet, also Europes largest ever  we follow his car journey from Brighton to Croydon as the world around him slowly crumbles and he loses it all.British Screenwriter and Director Steven Knight, brings us yet another gripping British drama, after previously making Hummingbird starring Jason Statham earlier this year. Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Locke is refreshingly short and never over stays its welcome. The narrative is actually so constant that even when Hardy is not in hands free phone switchboard mode, we capture another underlying story. Locke provides just as much a character journey as it does a car journey.During the recent UK Premiere, producer Paul Webster recalls his initial talks with Steven Knight, in which he said; I want to do something quite different, in a confined space, about a guy whose life changes during the course of one car journey. And we never leave the car. And that is literally what happens. Bringing an ideal mix of humour and emotion to the project, Hardys taunt performance is mesmerizing. The puton Welsh accent is pretty decent also. Filmed in just eight nights and with very low budget, the film is literally a lesson of how unique and quite fantastic minimalist cinema can be.",True

"My All Time Favourite Movie I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but hes everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said  was  in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script thats just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppolas involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldnt have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states  This movie isnt about Vietnam  It is Vietnam  hes right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the films setting ( The Manson trial suggests its 1970 ) had changed Americas view of both the world and itself and of the worlds view of America Its the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . Ive not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didnt feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel whos leading an injun war party , or a scifi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier whos leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrads original source novel My all time favourite movie and its very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IM Db",True

"Beautiful but unsatisfying Woody Allen often is an interesting and insightful directors, whose films regardless of how they come off overall look great, have great soundtracks and he often knows how to get strong performances out of actors, at his best his writing was a fine mix of the hilarious, the poignantly dramatic and the thoughtprovoking.Café Society is not one of his best films. Allens glory days were in the late 60s through to the early 90s, with the 70s and 80s (which saw masterpieces like Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanours and Manhattan for example) being particularly good decades. From mid90s onwards he became hit and miss, with the odd gem like Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine but generally his glory days are long gone.As far as his films from the 2010s decade go, Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine are vastly superior but Café Society does fare better than To Rome With Love and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. Café Society is not a great film, but is not a poor one, generally Allen has done worse (almost all of them being in the last twenty years or so) but it really isnt one of his better films.Its best asset is the magnificent cinematography, every shot takes the breath away and complements the also spoton and very handsomely produced 30s period detail perfectly. The soundtrack also is an ideal fit, giving a real sense of period as well as being a wonderful soundtrack on its own. There are shades of prime Allen writing, there are some very funny moments, some touching ones and it does evoke thought afterwards, Allens themes done in an insightful way.The story is simple but rarely dull, it is a long way from perfect as will be detailed later on in the review but it did maintain interest. Its nicely directed by Allen. Performances vary. Blake Lively is positively luminous and Steve Carrell shows that he is adept at comedy and drama in a role that requires both extremes. Was very pleasantly surprised by Kristen Stewart, she can not do much for me but this is proof that with good material she can be good, the role could easily have been hardly one at all but Stewart does make the role more interesting than he deserved to be.Jesse Eisenberg didnt work for me, he just plays a younger Woody Allen alter ego and it just comes off as a bad impersonation without being either funny or charming, instead its annoying and the neuroses are overdone. Corey Stoll also feels very out of place, didnt buy him for a minute as a mobster, the role didnt suit him in the first place and it didnt fit within the period.On top of this, the script and story execution arent perfect. Mostly the script is very enjoyable but some jokes, especially the badtaste and insensitive poking fun at Jews, do fall flat. Allens narration is irritating, overused and overexplanatory, more show and less tell please Allen, consequently giving Café Society an overwritten feel. The story does suffer from too much crammed in and sketchily developed characters (making the central relationships not quite as convincing as they ought to have been), and while there was no problem with a more morose at the end the ending just felt too inconclusive and gave the sense that Allen was indecisive as to how to finish the film.In conclusion, looks beautiful and has some enjoyable things but somewhat unsatisfying. 6/10 Bethany Cox",True

"A wonderful and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world.When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. Im always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this films endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyone whos ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this films gargantuan heart. Im a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see, but La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend this film enough.

"The more you watch it, the better it gets The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. Its a brilliant movie on a number of different levels  the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kungfu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. Its really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!Itd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, theres a couple of sequels on the way, so lets see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isnt by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best scifi movie of the decade, if not ever.Im yet to meet somebody who hasnt enjoyed it. Its my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too.",True
"Outstanding crime picture (and Hardy is a LEGEND).The infamous Kray brothers – identical twins Reggie and Ronnie – are so well known in British gangster history theyve already had multiple films made about them. What writerdirector Brian Helgeland brings to the table with his take on the notorious siblings is exuberant storytelling, classy visual styling and a tour de force performance by Tom Hardy as both twins. Hardys dual turn is undeniably the centrepiece of the movie. His Reggie is all charm and swagger, with intelligence and ambition to boot, whilst the schizophrenic Ronnie is a shorttempered ball of emotional bluster. Helgeland sensibly opts to make Reggie the focus; of the two he is the more grounded one, a gangster with lofty aspirations and the ability to interact on a human level with those around him to make his goals a reality. There is also genuine chemistry between Hardy (as Reggie) and Emily Browning, her fragile yet strongwilled Frances able to draw out the romantic side of Reggie, making his bursts of savagery all the more terrifying. Sporadically placed throughout the (overlong) two hour plus runtime, the bouts of violence bubble with intensity and exhilaration, often uneasily enjoyable thanks to moments of levity sprinkled alongside them. The 60s setting is capitalised on too, Dick Popes elegant photography giving proceedings a classical feel while Carter Burwells powerfully soulful score affects deeply at all the right times. Theres a sense of glorification here that mightnt sit well with some audience members, however the Krays were adored in the East End and to deny the glitzier parts of their life would be to deny what made them popular to begin with. An exceptional crime picture with two outstanding performances from one man, proving again that Hardy really is an acting legend.",False
"As it should have been and sometimes was While born three years after the events in the film, I could still relate to the plight of being a teenager on the threshold to adult life. I think it takes a pretty insensitive person not to be captivated by this excellent movie (boring?  because just one car blew up, or what?!). This was the 3rd or 4th time I saw it, and it is just getting better. It is unusual to see filmmaking of this caliber coming from Hollywood (not least when considering Lucas latest offering  blech!), but like movies like The Year My Voice Broke and My Life as a Dog, American Graffiti tells us something about where we came from, without being dull or preachy. ***½ out of ****",False
"not quite what I expected!First off, I was quite surprised to see the cinema so full for this movie, even on opening weekend. I guess not that many movies for women in their 30s plus exist these days!I expected this movie, as Im sure many people did, to be a Fatal Attraction but with the genders switched around.I was pleasantly surprised and shocked by it NOT being what I expected, and I definitely enjoyed it alot more than Fatal Attraction.The summary of this movie is that Diane Lanes character starts cheating on her husband (Richard Gere) with a beautiful French man(Olivier Martinez). Everything else should be left for surprise.The pacing of this movie is perfect. We got a sense of Connie and Edwards home life before she met the dashing Paul. They have a darling son, Charlie, who adds alot of humour to the movie, but in a non precocious way. After the affair starts we see Connies feelings range from excitement to complete disgust with herself. And of course Edward inevitably finds out. His reaction is interesting, to say the least, and perhaps very honest.
The acting is great, especially from Diane Lane. The sex scenes are pretty raunchy, and made me uncomfortable at certain points, but its interesting to see how different sex with the lover and sex with the husband were.At the end of this movie I didnt feel cheated or robbed with some contrived ending (although others may argue differently). This film dealt with how being in an affair must feel, and how finding out youre being cheated on could make your react in uncharacteristic ways.As a movie critic said, this movie will indeed make you never have an affair!",True
"An excellent movie with disastrous marketing We just saw this film previewed before release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two matters: There were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. Whats sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too heavy for them, while the people who would really enjoy it wouldnt be caught dead walking into the theater showing it. Too bad. A good film wasted.",False
"Comprised of spectacular performances, Johnny Depp and Co. carry this runofthemill B list Mob movie to relevance.Encompassed with episodic rhythm and an awfully conventional format, Scott Cooper mutates a story of rich soil capable of greatness to a detaching and routine crime film. Black Mass grasps only on the superficial layer as it focuses solely on documented events of the crime they organized. Due to this, the movie suffers as it seems to be merely a biography laying out these horrific events in these specified timeframes but not putting any focus on the characters that performed it. All action, but none of the story that happens between that allows the audience to view who they are and what theyre like. Black Mass fails to delve deeper into the roots, and this of course limits the scope of all the actors. Great mob cinematography such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the Sopranos all of these were so great because they allowed the audience to see what the characters were like when they werent shooting, beating, or plotting against people.That being said, in their limited boxes boy do these actors put on a show. Led by Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, the audience can tell straight from the start that this cast reveled and lived their roles. With the amount of overwhelming, heinous events; the film had to have someone coldhearted and sleazy, and woah did these actors become the epitome of that. However, due to this heavily limited character, the only rise the audience feels are from the bonechilling actions that these men did. Black Mass fails to captivate. And when the closing credits roll a feeling of disappointment washes over you, as it feels like you just watched an episode on the ID channel with really, really good actors.",False
"Boring I really fail to see the brilliance of the movie or of Xavier Dolan. Admittedly, it is the first movie of him I watched, and I will Watch others to try to understand why everybody think he is a Genius.On the story. Parents not aware of their childs sexuality and relatives trying to hide the truth. Really not original or special. It isnt enough to make a good film, perhaps a short. Other than that its very slow, and there is little to feed on, be it images or music. And full of clichés such as the violent and rough farmer. It is also not clear why he feels the need to disfigure the brothers friend in a bar, nor why he wasnt jailed for it or nobody questioned him about it, neither brother nor parents nor police. Or was it fine for his brother to have someone disfigured for him in a bar?What strikes about Dolan is this movie, apart from the horrible hair color, is how he seems to like filling the screen most of the time. I hadnt a stopwatch, but it feels like he is filling the screen, mostly his head, 5070 % of the time or more. Are we supposed to be ecstatic about the acting?All in all, this is a movie, that in my opinion, one can afford not to watch.Lets just say that nothing strikes as interesting or remarkable, from the story to the photography to the original soundtrack.

I watched it together with some Lithuanian people. I liked this movie as it is very special.Technically it is done very well. Not too many effects, nice cuts and setting. The plot is okay but the development of the characters is often not clear. Some decisions they make dont seem to make sense. Especially being a father I didnt understand the way, Ieva handles her sons problems. As the ending is in a way open I had to think a lot about it and the whole movie which is good in my opinion.The actors play their roles very good. I am looking forward seeing more of them.",False
"Mistress Misses Im a big Noah Baumbach fan. He is completely able to come up with clever, simple, original ideas and make a usually great movie out of them; but to my dismay, Baumbachs Mistress America is a bit of a miss.The story was very nice, but the writings cheap/obvious execution ruins it. There is a famous saying that originates from Anton Chekhov that is commonly used in film schools: show dont tell. This picture breaks that simple saying in almost all of its lines, as characters will just randomly blurt out how they feel  all while keeping a neutral look on their face. Baumbach has also made a living out of his quick wit and intellectual humor, but unfortunately in Mistress America, he decided to throw intellect out the window.There are a few redeeming factors: its Woody Allenesque use of camerawork, fitting choice of music, and easy to like characters. Though it doesnt live up to his previous films, Mistress America should be watched by Baumbach fans. If you dont like him, you wont like this; and if you havent seen his other work, I recommend you watch that instead.",True
"New avenue for Vin Diesel I had the opportunity to see this movie at the Screen Actors Guild in Hollywood last week along with a Q&A with Vin afterward. I have to say I didnt know what to expect after seeing his regular action roles, but I was very impressed. His acting skills have stepped up to the next challenge. Once I got the vision of sexy action star out of my head I was able to concentrate on the character at hand and by the end of the movie I was almost expecting the character to walk in instead of Vin Diesel! I rated this movie a 9 only because it had way more obscene language fillers than it needed. Its a mafia movie we get it. I just dont care to have so much cursing in a movie I think it takes away from the content. Also as a side note I was impressed with the Q&A after, no one can say that Vin is a muscle head. He is an articulate and passionate actor, as well as very humble. I was sitting about three feet from him during the interview and could see his hand twitching nervously as he addressed the small group of actors there. He most certainly has high marks in my book.",False
"I just didnt feel it.I stumbled upon the trailer on the internet, and it looked like it had all the makings of a quirky indie film: an interesting setup, a road trip, Tom Waits, so I was excited to see it, and... I dont know, it just fell kind of flat for me. It was neither all that funny, or all the dramatic, just sort of plodded along. There were whole spans of this movie that were aimless and without spark. The characters never become full or interesting. Its not bad, its not good, it felt like cinematic purgatory. I just kept waiting for the movie to take off, but then it was over. Patrick Fugit does a good job trying to make an incredibly uncompelling character watchable, and Shea Wighams a riot when given the chance. Still, youll spend the movie wishing there had been a more experienced director, crew and a more innovative writer (Charlie Kaufman, vielleicht?)",True
"Moving and inspiring I saw this last night at the Portland premiere with Gus Van Sant and James Franco among others. This is a powerful work and, in my opinion, Gus Van Sant has taken a big step towards the mainstream in his artistic direction. To me, the person who is by no means a movie expert, it seems that this movie had a much faster, accessible pace than his other movies. There were no longshots or minutes at a time without dialog, etc.Ive really never thought much of Sean Penn before, but, with this role, I expect him to sweep up the awards. Everyone was great in their parts, but he did such an excellent job in portraying the Harvey Milk that I have seen before in clips and documentaries. They did not make out Milk to be a choirboy, which was one thing I was afraid was going to happen. This story seems long overdue in its telling, but so completely relevant to todays news.I expect, as the movie hits theaters, this will cause quite a stir, with both sides using it as fodder in their fight. I expect the ratings will reflect this as there are already people giving it 0s who obviously did not attend the premiere. I dont think it deserves a 10 either, but is much, much closer to that end. Looked at objectively, it is a sometimes tearful, sometimes funny movie that was put together masterfully",True
"TIFF 2015  The Club: Exposing evil through brutal honesty Pablo Larrain (No) returns with another story that shadows his country with The Club. Before the details emerge, this story is nothing like No.The Club takes place in the somewhat remote coastal village of La Boca Navidad where a house of secret guests exists: they are either child molesters, baby snatchers, or were active supporters of Pinochet, and they were all Priests. They have all been excommunicated from the Catholic Church for their crimes and sent away to this house as not to harm the Churchs image instead of being put in the public eye and then thrown in jail. The house is quarterbacked by a Nun who also suffered a similar fate as her house guests.One day, a new guest comes to join The Club, only to be eventually tracked down by a former altar boy who shouted claims of constant abuse from outside the house for him to hear. Not long after, we learn that these claims are true, and the reaction sets off a further investigation into the requirement for the house and the livelihood of the guests who reside there.The Club isnt an artistic work that should be shared for praise and glorified for any kind of distinction. Instead, it clearly details the horrific nature of how the Catholic Church deals with their worst offenders — by putting them in houses in rural locations, 100% funded by the Church. As the film progresses, we learn that the house mates have ways of passing the time — good and bad. Some are healthy, while others are vices. Eventually, when the house comes under inspection by the Church as to whether it should remain or not, extreme actions are taken to try and keep things intact.While advertised as a dark comedy, this film is almost nowhere near that. It was intended to show the evil behind the Church, and that its image cannot be tarnished. In a continent that houses 40% of the worlds Catholics, a film like this definitely sticks a thorn in the Churchs side. It gets dark, it gets rather nasty, it gets brutal, but, while its just a story with fictional accounts, they were created via true stories over the years.Watch this film with the expectation that you will be shocked by what you see and hear, but hopefully you will be moved enough to know that theres evil where good supposedly resides.",False
"A beautifully depicted masterpiece I was absolutely astonished with how wonderful The Air I Breathe turned out to be. I was expecting it to be really good, basically because of the starstudded cast I believe it has, and in the end, I got an amazing journey with a beautiful story everywhere I looked. First of all, the actors and actresses of this film make it absolutely unable to miss. They all capture their characters perfectly and make the film unable to look away from with their dedicated, spoton performances. The plot was also majestic and deep. It was touching and moving in so many ways, and they way it all made sense in the end was simply brilliant. There is not one scene where I thought the creators have added in something mediocre or unnecessary, and there was not one scene where I pressed the pause button to do something, for I could not stop watching it.It shows how everyones lives all intertwine in some way and how one persons honest actions can affect the life of another who honestly needs help when they cant find it anywhere else, and it is honestly as beautiful and worth the watch as I am making it sound, honest. This is a mustsee, I recommend it for everyone, and usually the haters have to complain about how boring and confusing it is, while I found it at the right pace to keep your attention and understood everything the film meant for us to understand along the way.",False
"Second American best film of the eighties It might seem odd to call this an American film, as its director, Wim Wenders is a German film director, who , unlike his predecessors, Lang, Murnau, Pabst, Von Sternberg , and Billy Wilder, has chosen to remain aloof from the Hollywood film industry. But Paris Texas is as much an  American film as Tocquevillles Democracy in America is an American book. Sometimes it takes a foreigner ( In Wim Wenders case, a foriegner who loves American music, American movies and American literature.) to look  into the American soul. In this case,it helps  that he is working with a greatand misunderstood American  writer, Sam Shephard, and a greatand under appreciated American actor, Harry Dean Stanton. I can not begin to convey who poetic, how haunting, and how beautiful this film is, and how artfully it probes the American heart. The scene where Stanton confronts his wife, and tells what he did and why he did it, must rank among the supreme scenes, not just of film, but of human life. It echoed  the great scenes of our literature, such as Ulysses meeting with Penelope, and the return of the prodigal son. In short, the only film which goes beyond it in the eighties is Raging Bull, and that is largely because of the volcanic power of Scorsese, that most selfcrucifying of auteurs. in short, I would go so far as to say that Paris Texas is more than a ten...Like Citizen Kane, like 2001, like Andrei Roublev, like Raging Bull , like the Searchers, like Pickpocket, Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai and Ordet,it is an ELEVEN.

This movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasnt me, it was actually the movies Ive seen this year.This movie has its flaws for sure.

The very fact that they failed to use the amazing original recordings of these artist(most likely to save on production costs)shows that the filmmaker had ultimately no real interest in their music or history, and just wanted to make some money(and keep it all for themselves again). The one and only redeeming quality of this movie is that hopefully, people who watch it will find the REAL recordings of these artist and actually LISTEN to them. I myself dont care about their personal lives. I just love the music.",False
"Entertaining no brainer Top Gun is a high quality, visually stunning film that does all it can to take your breath away. It is the excellently choreographed dog fights that remain in the mind longer than anything as they are high octane, dazzling bursts of excitement which bring the film to life. However, fighter jet sequences do not make a film and it is the plot where Top Gun has some occasional problems.Parts of the story are overly cheesy and clichéd. The proud to be American theme is dire, repetitive and anyone who dislikes over patriotism in films will despise this. The story line involving Tom Cruise and Tom Skerrit approaches boredom and is the pinnacle of Top Guns cheese. Cheese is OK, as long as it is not serious and that is where that specific story line falls flat. The fun cheesy parts are some of the films best moments. The volleyball scene is truly a classic and the four actors involved are genuinely enjoying themselves. The relationship between Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards is also very moving at times and the dynamic they have makes for great viewing.The acting is what saves Top Gun from being Tinsel town garbage. Tom Cruise launched his career with this film. His cocky smile makes him perfect for this role and Cruise does fantastically at portraying a determined, passionate character. It is the emotional scenes where Cruise really sets himself apart from his peers. Cruise provides the few scenes where the audience are made to feel any emotion and he carries out his responsibility creditably. Anthony Edwards as Goose is also effective as the man who takes second spot to Cruises Maverick. He is instantly popular with the audience with his wit, humour and charm. Val Kilmer and Rick Rossovich are great as the rivals. They play off each other really well and do a fantastic job to personify arrogance. Michael Ironside does what he does best and once again, manages to go through a whole film without smiling.The story between Cruise and Kelly Mc Gillis is very romantic and sensual. The heat between them is conveyed very well on screen and it is this that sets Top Gun above films such as Iron Eagle and Chuck Norris films.Berlins Take My Breath Away is a song that still gets a good deal of airplay and suits this film to perfection; its cheesy and its 80s. The music is very effective at setting the mood and complements the feel of the film.Top Gun is a film that achieves its objectives, to entertain. If youre looking for intelligent writing or mass thought provocation, this film isnt for you. Top Gun is best suited to those who desire to switch off their brain and enjoy.",False
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a film directed by Mike Newell. With every instalment of the series, my anticipation for the film also increased. And I can say even with the fourth instalment, the excitement is never reduced.Plot: Harry Potter is selected by the Goblet of fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament making him the youngest ever to compete much to the chagrin of everyone.Story and direction: This is the first film in the series not to have the first scene at Privett Drive. I thought it was the right move considering the film has many things going on. During the first fifteen minutes or so, the film feels quite fast paced. I didnt get the understanding as to what his happening. If the makers would have given a little importance to the beginning, I guess the film would have worked wonders. But after those initial minutes, I was totally engrossed in the movie. There were some new characters to look out for and I can say all of them impressed. Also some of the VFX work in this film is incredible especially the broom scenes which have greatly improved. With that being said, I would add that the tournament scenes were well directed. There is always a sense of tension in the atmosphere during the scenes as you care for the safety of those characters. The film also brings another aspect of the trios friendship into light which was very nicely handled. This is the first film also not to feature John Williams as score composer. But I can very well say that Patrick Doyle did a spectacular job as composer. The film do marks the very first appearance of Voldemort and I can say that he is terrifying. With his appearance and the buildup that has beenmade, you can say that this man means business and also that he is ruthless and would harm just anyone who comes his way. Performances: If I had to pinpoint I had to say that this was by far Daniel Radcliffes best as Harry Potter. The emotional side had never been explored until this film as it was great. As for new characters, Ralph Fiennes just nailed it as Voldemort. He just looks as the villain you predicted. Brendan Gleeson brings his charm to the screen and that just lights up the scene itself. Robert Pattinson also justifies his performance. Timothy Spall and David Tenant gave good support. As for rest of the cast, always just do justice to their roles and never have they given me a single reason to complain.Favorite Scene: It would be the Yule Ball scene where the boys after the initial dance just sit at one side and are jealous of Hermione seeing she is having a lot of fun unlike them. This very well depicts the teenagers who are at that age.Verdict; Thanks to Mike Newell and Steve Kloves we have got another griping chapter to the series. Except for the first fifteen minutes, I enjoyed the entire film.I am going with a 9/10.",True
"Wonderful movie I never comment on movies here, usually I just use this website to get an idea of what I am about to watch but I saw this movie last night and loved it. This movie is a fairytale set in real life circumstances. I really like that the film was never advertised as an Oliver Twist take, but I loved all of the allusions to it. It was a very creative take on the classic story. The poor orphan boy who wants nothing more than to be loved.My favorite aspect of the movie was how infused music actually was in the movie. I am a musician and I liked the touches that the filmmakers went into to make the film seem as credible as a fairytale can be. I also like how it brought together modern rock, classic symphonic music, and modern symphonic music. It didnt really glamorize the lifes of everyday musicians. I like all of the extra little things that were thrown into the movie that only a musician would get. There were some errors but for the most part I applaud the film makers for the attention to the musical details.Yes the movie was a bit bit corny, and a little over the top, but for the most part I loved it and suggested it to every one.",False
"a terrific, slowly unfolding debut with sublime performances Steven Soderbergh, as observed by other reviewers and critics, did take inspiration from the kinds of films Eric Rohmers been making for decades. These kinds of films, as Sex, Lies, and Videotape is at its core, about people in morality crises, and how they get out of them or linger with how they act is the point.  Some people may not like the film, therefore, as nothing incredibly outrageous or spectacular will occur.  For all the attention Soderbergh received (Golden Palm, Independent Spirits, Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, immediate recognition), hes made a small film, and its not as ambitious as some of his later, greater works like Out of Sight and Traffic.  But as a revealing, intimate character study, with an often clever and controlled misenscene, Soderbergh shows his skills were already honed at twentysix.Without good acting the film would be like a hopeless rendition of a foreign film, but with the four lead performances from Mc Dowell, Gallagher, Gia Como, and Spader (his is most understated of the bunch for me) these are as fully realized characters as Soderbergh could get.  They all mustve taken something about the characters in the script, because for all the flaws and misconceptions and fears these characters carry, they are human.  Even Gallaghers John, whos the conniving husband and lawyer, is recognizably as he is even when hes comparatively lesser than Graham and Ann.  Only one side character, the barfly played by Steven Brill, gets the film to immediately halt with uncomfortable humor.  But the rest of the film, loaded with innuendo (theres not one shot of nudity, similar to a Rohmer film like Chloe in the Afternoon, where the cover art of the film is rather misleading to those looking for a film with breasts and other parts) and involving drama, doesnt shake its foundations until maybe the last five to ten minutes.  And when it does, it does not make the film a lost cause, at least for me.  Begs to be seen again, though with maybe a year or so between viewings.  A",True
"Makes Thirteen look bad Mean Creek ***1/2/out of 4Mean Creek has the most accurate depiction of teen life and adolescence Ive ever seen in a movie. Unlike Thirteen, which is stereotypical and tries to give answers and resolutions, Mean Creek sticks out in the teenlife genre as a beauty. The young actors and actresses do a great job, but Carly Schroeder as Millie is the best. She gets to your gut as the innocent kid whos in the wrong place at the wrong time. One of the most memorable parts for me in the movie is when the Bully, George, is filming with his camcorder and zooms in on an exotic spiral shape, saying This is my life. Thats such a brilliant line because adolescence is such a horrible and awkward stage in life. High schoolers (being one myself) are filled with an assortment of emotions and feelings and Mean Creek portrays that with such power. Like Deliverance, the film is focused on a canoe trip that goes completely wrong and Mean Creek  has some themes that Deliverance has. Jacob Aaron Estes is a director who is off to a great startmaking films that are completely honest in every way.",True
"A different look at wrestling, in a good way!My first night at the Stockholm Film Festival turned out really great thanks to Foxcatcher. A movie I didnt expect much from, but it was in fact one of the best movies of 2014. Foxcatcher is a movie that doesnt have that much action and will surely disappoint those who loves wrestling and wants to see fights. This is not a movie about the good side of the sport, its about the bad one we dont get to see when Hulk Mania and The Rock performs nowadays.The film is based upon a true story. Mark Schultz is an Olympic wrestler. His relationship with his sponsor, John du Pont and his older brother leads to very unlikely circumstances between both. John du Pont turns out to be a bit different than the man he first seemed like.What I first wondered when I read about the film was, how could they pick Channing Tatum for such a dramatic role? Isnt he that guy who just shows off his abs so the girls can look at something? Well, in this movie Channing was someone completely different. He is superb as Mark Schultz, I couldnt imagine anyone else playing him after seeing this film. And this is partly what makes the film very watchable and good. Steve Carell (who usually stars in sex comedies) also did an amazing job as John du Pont. I could barely recognize him at first, and forgot that it was him 10 minutes after he first appeared on the screen. In the end, I also forgot what he looks like in real life. Great job on the make up there!The good performances is definitely what I enjoyed the most. Im not into wrestling, and Foxcatcher didnt really make me interested. Its a very deterrent example of how some Olympic athletes are trained and treated when theyre not on TV. The movie will be out in theaters later this month, and I suggest you to go watch it. If youre not a fan of wrestling, thats even better. I dont like the sport but loved this movie.However, pick your theater carefully. Sadly, some people in front of me waited to see Channing Tatum naked during the beginning. They were just annoying, but quiet when they realized that they werent watching a teen comedy. Which was, around thirty minutes into the film. So I didnt really mind! The movie is a bit over two hours long...",True
"raw drama, digital filmmaking, sundance hitmy favorite drama in the 2001 Sundance festival ,Manic was a frightening look at teenagers out of control and how the world forces them to desparate measures. Set in a juvenile mental institution it tells the story of Lyle ( Joseph Gordon Levitt, in an amazing, breakout dramatic performance) put under lock and key for assaulting another boy with a baseball bat.  He rejects the system, its diagnosis and its blindness to the real problems he and the other kids are facing. Brutally honest and inspiring (without any schlocklyhokey feel good crap) shot in DV and improved and made with the help of REAL kids in this terrible situation, Manic was an example of what a film festival should support. Also I would be doing a great disservice if I didnt mention the quiet commanding presence of young actor Cody Lightning (only 14 years old!!!!!)See this film!",False
"Whats up with Hollywood?I have never written a review in IM Db. This is my first time. Why? Because the movie hasnt been released in USA yet, and I just watched in India. Seeing just 5 reviews, I wanted to give mine too.Whats up with Hollywood? Other than spectacular visuals and 3D, they dont seem to care enough about anything else. In Exodus, by the famed director Ridley Scott, he surpassed many elements in visual effects. I have never ever seen so detailed visuals of ancient buildings, slums of slaves, and huge ocean waves and what not. 3D adds a lot of pleasure in viewing such effects.Thats it! There is nothing more that I could appreciate. It feels very empty. No emotions at all. Acting by Christian Bale is quite alright, but it is nothing special. Some scenes are memorable. But the lack of good writing, script, and no contribution from other actors diminish the effect of Bale as well. It is hard to imagine the same guy directed Gladiator (I havent seen Aliens and blade runner). But there is everything missing in Exodus that made Gladiator a hit.At many places, it is boring, even if the cinematography and visual effects are great. In the beginning, you would feel as if Ridley took you to the ancient Egyptian world, just because of the small details shown in the effects. However, any interest or so will end in next 10 minutes or so, when the story starts lacking.So, my question remains. Whats up with Hollywood? Is this much technology and huge funding to such directors destroying the creativity. Why no body cares about character building and good script? At one level, it feels extremely sad that with this budget and this talent in technology, even a slight efforts and honesty towards script, story, and dialogue can take such movies to a masterpiece level. But...no! We are going to earn a lot of money. You are going to enjoy watching the magnificent sequence of millions of frog jumping in ancient buildings. Call it even? Really?",False
"Excellently made, Streep wonderful, Redford miscast Fifty years ago I was living in the Kenya highlands, only a few miles from the old Blixen farm. Not a great deal had changed since the 1920s, the period of the movie, which manages a reasonable recreation. However, the background is unlikely to mean much to Americans, only confirming unreal stereotypes of the colonial British. Meryl Steep, as we have come to expect, is superb in the part; and in 2003 she conarrated a wonderful documentary on the remarkable Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen), to whom in fact she bears some physical resemblance. Robert Redford is badly miscast, and why the producers didnt get one of many superb English actors for the part I cant imagine. As a love story well told in what to most people will be an exotic setting, beautifully photographed, it should be highly rated, justifying its many awards.",False

Those two characters are wonderfully played by inevitable acting award nominees Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield Eisenberg owns the brisk pace of the film while Garfield brings most of the humanitywho anchor a terrific ensemble SAG best ensemble, perhaps? The films score is a perfectly atmospheric concoction of electronica from edgy dark horse best original score nominees Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and its all united under the name and vision of David Fincher, who did not win an Oscar for Fight Club or Zodiac or Benjamin Button.All of this is to say two things: this is a really great movie from a phenomenal creative team, and also there are times when the film feels somewhat calculated for accoladesnever in the repugnantly safe, crowd pleasing, middlebrow Benjamin Button sense, but in the sweetly transparent sense of a kid who did all his chores and is suggesting that he might deserve a cookie. You know what? Give David Fincher a cookie. The Social Network is thoroughly intelligent and engaging as a modern biopic and as an examination of evolving cultural currency, and its also one of my favorite films this year. TK 10/1/10",True
"Stalker is not boring It seems to me that I see Tarkovsky movies differently from many other people. For me this film is not too long or boring. For me this is one of the best movies ever made.Western culture has a very long tradition of filmmaking. Usually typical western movie is focused on story. (Of course  not always) The sharpness and tension of the movie are achieved by the big number of cuts or by the fast varying of shots or by the sudden varying of plans or by some surprising angle of camera etc. Tarkovsky dont like cuts. The number of cuts is minimal. His camera is moving like in dream (Bergman envied Tarkovsky for that), it has no angles at all. Colours are pale, dirty, very tender, soft, almost blackandwhite.In a typical western movie dialog is followed by the camera. Picture is illustrating text and is subordinated to it. In Stalker text and visual image are coexisting, cooperating with eachother. Both are moving on their own ways but at the same time, somehow  harmonically. Text and picture are not subordinated, they are both independent.Why is Tarkovsky using such a weird language? Surely not only because he wants to opposite the dogmas of western cinema. He has a positive message too. Audience of his films has to understand his films not only at the level of thinking or emotions, but at the level of much deeper consciousness. Therefore watching his movies means rather meditation than watching T Vandeatingpopcorn. The purpose of Tarkovskys films is to loose the mind of audiences, to wake it up to much deeper attention. So that audiences can simply watch and see.Stalker is not an entertainment and is not supposed to be. It means there is no sense at all to watch Stalker, when you need some amusing entertainment. Stalker is a serious movie. It is very narrowminded to evaluate movies on the assumption of entertainment only. Of course, we live in the world of movieconsumers, produced by powerful filmcompanies, demanding more and more and more exciting entertainment. Consumer doesnt understand this movie. For him it is big bore.",True
"Resonates with me I really enjoyed this movie. Looking back in hindsight, I can see the selfishness of the characters, and I have read the complaints about this, but isnt that kind of the whole point of the movie? Its about people talking about not selling out while at the same time they ARE selling out in many different ways. They (the characters in the movie) are all consumers who satirize the very idea of consumerism but refuse to stoop down to the level of getting menial jobs to try and pay the bills. The movie defines for me how education isnt everything and from my own experience I have learned that sometimes the great dream (of being a writer, artist, musician, etc.) just doesnt pay the bills and in order to make decent money one may have to go into a field that is not originally their first choice as a means of employment. I remember being young and wistful, with dreams of being an artist, only to have to settle for an office job to make ends meet.The movie does express what life was like for me at the time. I was a naive student with dreams of producing great artistic work, but who learned that what is taught in college as reality is not really reality at all. College students are fed with lofty artistic statements and philosophies and are taught to analyze endless aspects of society, ideals, etc., and are taught that knowledge and education are power but are not taught that credibility and respect are things which must be earned and that very few people actually start out at the top of the career ladder.Overall, this continues to be one of my favorite films and I appreciate the myriad of messages that it sends, though they may, at times, be contradictory.",True
"It has a lot more subtext than its naysayers will tell you...It may be easy to write this fantasy/love story off as a bloated boxoffice winner with a heart of F/X, however the performances are so winning, and the Oscarwinning script so satisfying, I cant believe it doesnt rate higher with viewers. Murdered businessman (Patrick Swayze, not a good actor but doing OK here) sets out in ghostly form to bring his killers to justiceand to watch out over his lovely girlfriend (Demi Moore, hitting all the right notes of a grieving lover). Whoopi Goldberg won a Supporting Oscar as a fake medium and Tony Goldwyn is uncanny as a slimeball exfriend (his sniveling is so convincing it may have cost him reallife celebrity). Extremely welldirected by Jerry Zuckerin anybody elses hands, this might have turned to mush. ***1/2 from ****",True
"Subtle Da(e)mon I think this might be Damons best performance since the Good Will Hunting movie. At least it felt to me like that. And Im not saying that to put movies like Bourne or Oceans down, they are a lot of fun (on different levels), but performance wise he didnt have to stretch that many muscles (action wise on the other hand, he obviously had to, at least with the Bourne Trilogy).The story is pretty simple and the anti Hero is quite ordinary. Which might make it less appealing to a large audience, but it wasnt aimed to crack the box office. Soderbergh captures a weird feeling in this movie, that leaves you with a weird taste at the end. Of course, you could argue, that the movie shows too little of Damons wife, maybe even too little of his employer. But as it is, its a pretty solid and greatly edited work.Even the voice over, which seems and is completely out of place, works really good in this movie. I guess even the Team America members would change their opinion of Matt Damon after watching this one. Give it a try, but dont expect laugh out loud comedy (not the ordinary kind that is).",True
"to call it a disappointment might almost be a compliment, but I dare you to see it Note: This works MUCH better on a repeat viewing, practically a masterpiece, and one of the perfectly sad comedies ever made... though the last ten minutes is a slog (perhaps intentionally, as its near the end of the tunnel... but its still unbearable).Over the course of my teenage years Ive seen Being John Malkovich through Eternal Sunshine (those two the Mword, masterpieces, with Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind neargreat, and Human Nature a fun minor work), and hes always given something to chew on for the brain. Hes an incredible wit, maybe too incredible, like something that could combust with the amount of ideas and ruminations and skill at defining whats important to us as people and what we want out of art. Synecdoche, New York could be seen as his lifesummation of what concerns him as a writer. And to call it art is simple, because it is: it is, alongside the something like Inland Empire, the most challenging work to come out of American cinema. To say that either one is flawed may come as something as a given, but for Kaufman its somewhat more troubling.This is a big film of ideas, crucial, lifeaffirming (or lifedamning) thoughts about love and death and loss and forgiveness and, essentially, the process of trying to recreate and recreate and recreate this. But at the same time the intellect to engage fulltilt by Kaufman the writer, the director couldnt engage me as a viewer emotionally  at least at first. This changed on a second viewing  Im reminded of Woody Allens assertion on multiple viewings of 2001 that Kubrick was much ahead of him on what he was doing  but on a first impression I have to wonder, with everything going for Kaufman the satirist, the original, the sad dramatist, what the movies audience really is. Like the play that is rehearsed for decades that Cotard never brings to his audience, what can one take away from Synecdoche, New York as far as connecting with the characters, or just Cotard?Maybe it reveals something about me just talking about this; indeed this is probably the film of the season, if not just the year (Dark Knight fanatics take note), that you will want to talk about after it ends. As far as puzzling works of art go its great for a good argument, especially if one is familiar with how Kaufmans work has been leading up to this point. Its not exactly that the film is ever so confusing that one will want to walk out  there is a logic, in a sense, to the life imitating art imitating life imitating art etc etc aspect that makes sense. When Kaufman, as director, makes his film this time about as hopeful as Franz Kafka rewatching the Zapruder film on a loop, even the scenes and moments that *do* feel somewhat powerful emotionally (i.e. Hoffman seeing his daughter in a nudiebooth, or the final scene on the bed with Hoffman and Morton old and in bed with the house, once again, on fire) dont hit their mark  again, at least at first. Its almost as if seeing the film again it becomes deeper, more resonant; like any work of art at another point in ones life, it could change, and if one gives it the chance it does. Certainly the cast makes it worthwhile to watch: Hoffman is what he is, brilliant at transforming physically as age goes by as Caden Cotard, and at delivering subtle moments of humor amid his healthdecay; ditto in her own right to Morton, who ranges from bubbly and lustful to anrgy and dejected (Michelle Williams, too, shows this range); even a bit part by Dianne Wiest is appreciated. They all help to give life to what is a big, somber meditation on (quoting Douglas Adams) Life, the Universe, and Everything.And yet, expressing my (initial) disappointment over the length (at 124 minutes it feels twice as long) or the music (did Kaufman order killmyselfpianotunesyoulllove off of ebay for this?) or the personal problem of connecting emotionally with some of the characters as they (intentionally) dont really grow, shouldnt, I hope, diminish recommending Synecdoche, New York for anyone who wants something to challenge them, provoke thought and discourse, to engage and disrupt brainwave patterns. Perhaps there should be some disappointment; like life, and the art pulled out of it with pliers, its not always a pretty sight, especially near the end. But it is a unique journey I was glad to take, and I hope every few years or so to come back to it, and see if it changes me, or if Ive changed, since seeing it last.",True
"Wow!!!Ive never felt so compelled to write in on how I feel about a movie until I had experienced The Sunset Limited last night on HBO. I was really moved. I actually burst into tears at one point. Two men having a philosophical debate about life and death and the idea that knowledge is a burden, and the more we know, the more miserable we become is one point of debate in this powerful film. Some of the best writing and acting Ive seen, anywhere.Multiple viewings may be required for most to fully absorb the impact. A real punch in the gut. I actually felt like dusting off my old Bible and thumbing through it for a while when the movie ended.I dont know what else to say about this movie except that if you have not seen it yet, you MUST. It makes so much sense and it is a real eye opener.Mc Carthy is genius. I love all is work and this is just an absolute masterpiece of writing. Tommy Lee Jones and my man Sammy L. are absolutely mesmerizing. I have not seen acting this good in a long time.There is so much I want to tell you about this film, but words just cannot do it justice. I loved every second of this film, and I hope you do to.P.S. I NEVER give a movie 10 stars because I like to reserve that honor for something that is truly special. This is truly special.",True
"This really sums it up This was a spectacular depiction of the life and times of Miami in its criminal hay day. I witnessed the carnage first hand as a member of federal law enforcement and this documentary hits the nail squarely on the head. What made this really enjoyable for me is the way the director conveys the story. It is flashy and all over the place... just like Miami at that time. This was one of the few documentaries that told the stories of both sides of the struggle. The makers of this film were also able to do something very difficult. They assembled interviews from both sides of the fight. Anyone that is or was in my line of work knows how difficult it is to pull that off. Most documentaries are steeped in biased rhetoric and never give the viewer the chance to form an opinion based on all the facts. For those of us who remember those days and can be honest with ourselves and others about the gravity of that situation, it stirs up a long stored emotion. I can understand why people may find this documentary offensive or cheap, politically correct agendas have a way of skewing reason. That mentality is probably why this behavior has gone on so long. I wish I could take some of the misinformed back in time to see the reality of those times. It makes the nonsense of today look like Disney World. This documentary was an excellent depiction of the times.",False
"Amazing Soundtrack of 80s What makes a good film for me is that it is enjoyable, entertaining, gripping, likable and emotional. Flashdance without a doubt ticks all these five boxes. Flahdance is a very retro, cheesy entertaining film that is at no point boring and never drags, and is also a very clear symbol of the great 1980s and the night club exotic dancing scene of the time. Jennifer Beals puts down an amazing performance, as a dancer and as an actress. I guess the story comes down to the fact that reality bites, that life is tough, but if you push hard you just might make it.All in all, Flashdance despite its few undeniable faults is a very decent and enjoyable film in my opinion. As it mostly meets all of my requirements I am happy to give it a positive review. This film is one of the quintessential 80s films, that works well as a symbolic artifact of its time. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves 80s.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",False
"hood ornaments, but this is more than an ornament Its hard to believe that John Singletons work degenerated so in later years, because his debut was a masterpiece. We probably all have to agree that Boyz n the Hood was basically the first growing up in the ghetto movie, showing how these African American youths are surrounded by violence during their childhoods  some perpetrated by the cops, some is their own doing  but they all have to find a way to keep going. If the movie has any problem, its that it opened the flood gates to a series of similar inferior movies (but also the hilarious satire Dont Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood).Anyway, this is the one that I recommend. Cuba Gooding Jr. made a very good debut. Also starring Laurence Fishburne, Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long and Angela Bassett.",False
"It isnt style without substance  it is style with poor substance After seven years in solitary confinement between a cell containing a chess master and a cell containing a con artist, Jake leaves to seek revenge on Macha with the vast amount of money he has gotten from gambling. He starts his revenge with humiliation but soon blacks out only to be told by a doctor that he has mere days to live. Mysterious loan sharks Zack and Avi offer him protection from death in return for all his money. Meanwhile Macha puts a hit out on Jake. With death and betrayal everywhere, somebody is playing the ultimate highstakes game  but are all the players known, and who will emerge victorious?I had someone ask me recently if Id seen this because they wanted a second opinion. The reason for this, they said, was that they thought it was good one minute, then terrible the next, then maybe it is good again, then not, then it ended. Of course being asked for an opinion peaked my interest (and boosted my ego) and I was planning to watch it anyway, just to see for myself what about it deserved such a slating from the critics. In answer to the latter statement it must be said that, unsurprisingly, the film did not deserve the universal condemnation it received in the press and in truth it was just another time to lay into someone who had gotten too big for his boots and perhaps needed taking down a peg or two  and a weak project was the perfect reason. It happens every year  critics have so many mediocre films to write about that a good one sees loving reviews in the same way as a bad one is the chance to write a really memorable, scathing review  whether either it is truly deserved or not.So this leaves me with my colleagues statement and on that I found him to be accurate because at times it does SEEM to be a really cool film that is going somewhere interesting. This impression is built around a good start and pace to the film, with plenty of tough posturing, mystery and style. In fact, to deny that the film is delivered with style would be bad form indeed because the film does look very cool and very interesting. Problem is that, at some point, that isnt enough and once you get beyond the halfway mark you get the increasing feeling that this isnt going anywhere nearly as interesting or clever as you would like to think. By the ending that feeling will be confirmed as correct as the film stumbles into a pretentious and poorly delivered conclusion to the story and characters. Ritchie had been quite unreasonably arrogant about people who dont get his film but to me not only is it his fault for the hamfisted delivery of his twist, but as writer he also has come up with an idea for a twist that reads like a poor copy of other, better films. It just doesnt play and the cold (if stylish) approach keeps the audience at a distance so we care less than we should and are given more opportunity to see the twists as pretentious and halfcooked.Within this messy and slightly nonsensical affair the cast actually do pretty well by playing to the style rather than the content. Statham makes the best of his situation with another tough presence on screen even if, ultimately, I dont think he buys his character himself and thus cannot be part of the sale to the audience. Liotta I quite liked even though the unhinged violent criminal thing is pretty much the equivalent of him staring out the window with everything set to cruise control. Pastore and Benjamin are a cool presence who drive the film early on (with the mystery of their characters) but gradually become less engaging as the plot unravels. The rest of the cast pretty much provide solid enough tough men without (fortunately) sinking into the easy apples and pears type performances that Ritchie seems to like in his films generally. The only performance of real note though is from Ritchie as director because he pulls everything together with a lot of visual style and imagination; shame then that the worst performance is also from him as a writer because he has produced a script so full of its own cleverness that it cannot be bothered to aim for engaging the audience and sits back arrogantly while the delivery is fudged and incoherent.Revolver is not the screaming disaster that everyone would have you believe, but this is as close to a recommendation as I can give it. Visually it is stylish and early on this sense of tough coolness does draw you into the plot to see where it goes. Sadly though the answer is that it doesnt go anywhere worth being and it goes there with a slow pace that suggests it is being very clever and worthy when really the plot is not anywhere as clever or as developed as it needed to be. It isnt style without substance  it is style with poor substance.",False
"Could have been good but just not so...Well, I had high hopes for this movie. I had awaited its release and enjoyed the build up... hearing that Shia Lebouff didnt wash for weeks in order to get into role; much to the annoyance of the other cast members... Though, in truth this movie didnt reveal a lot about what it was like living and fighting through the war. I understood nothing after watching the movie about how cramped or what it might be like to live, fight and die inside a tank. Instead it seemed like its the best job ever  alcohol in the pantry and (seemingly) plenty of space...The movie did provide loud noises. Colourful explosions. Some gruesome and somewhat shocking deaths. Some love. Some hate. And about as many war movie clichés as could be fit into the running time. Seriously, the end of the film will have you thinking  This is definitely an American made movie. I would still rate it as a decent war movie. Though, do not get your hopes up. There has been such a dry patch and nothing can come close to Saving Private Ryan or the characterisation of band of brothers series...This movie played all the stereotype characters and yes they did play well. But I wanted so much more from the film. I wanted to feel like I had learnt a bit of history or at least a bit of insight after the screening. Instead all I learnt was that American blockbusters still play the stereotypes, the clichés and SO much cheese at the end the movie ends up stinking. Enjoy for an easy war flick but dont expect too much.",True
"Ultimately, you may just have to settle for a ray of hope.Theres a very fine line between probing into human failings and allout misery. Director Thomas Vinterbergs latest balances itself precariously between the two throughout, wavering between plot elements that seem grounded in its characters emotional realities and those that are unnecessarily grim. Ultimately however, the movie redeems itself thanks to fine ensemble work and its daring, assured direction.Submarino is the unforgettable story of two brothers, long estranged and haunted by a dark secret buried in their past, who live separate lives in modern day Copenhagen. Nick (Jakob Cedergren), a violent excon, tries to help out an old friend, but falls quickly into old habits. Meanwhile, his brother (Peter Plaugborg), raises his son, but is unable to escape his own demons of addiction. Each is on a path to selfdestruction, and they must find each other  before its too late.The cast is uniformly strong  both Cedegren and Plaugborg are solidly believable in their roles. Cedegrens acting, minimal and yet poignant, is especially remarkable. Vinterberg has a genuine respect for his characters and a desire to see them transcend their trappings, and his film, in turn, mostly succeeds where it could so easily have fallen short. When its numerous narrative threads finally converge, the resulting pathos feels genuinely earned and authentic. Adapted from the novel by Jonas T. Bengtsson, Submarino was an official selection at the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival.",True
"Great Cotten and sexy Monroe Joseph Cotten was an outstanding actor whose talents have been terribly underappreciated. He is great in this movie as an abusive husband. The very sexy Marilyn Monroe is his wife, who is having an affair with another man. They meet a pair of young newlyweds on their honeymoon. Max Showalter as the young husband is one of the most annoying characters Ive ever seen. Jean Peters as his bride does the unthinkable, managing to look almost as beautiful as Marilyn herself.This is a suspenseful and entertaining movie, which makes great use of the scenery surrounding Niagara Falls.",True
"A Royal Treat You heard it from me: Not even James Franco with his boffo performance in 127 Hours can beat Colin Firth for the Oscar in Kings Speech, a docudrama about the Duke of York (Firth) becoming King George VI while overcoming a crushing stutter. Not only does the actor get pitch perfect the stutter, but he also invests a kindness, courage, and vulnerability in the character that work in harmony to create an unforgettable George in an exquisite period peace.Not to forget how generously Geoffrey Rush underplays Lionel, the speech therapist who is instrumental in making the king a speaker and a friend. That lowkey acting allows Firth the room to expand his kings personality without interference from an Oscarwinning costar. This is history as I like to learn it—honest and engaging with palaces and minor characters wellappointed and underplayed themselves as part of a mosaic of challenges facing a handicapped king and a nation on the brink of WWII. The pace is close to languid, better to allow us to settle in for the painful transformation of a man unused to public speaking but used to family mocking his disability.Georges bravery is the films heartbeat, not flamboyant courage, mind you, but rather the kind that wakes us up to the character as complex and lovable. But valor is not his exclusively, Guy Pearces Edward, who abdicates for his love, Wallace Simpson, can be seen as a courageous man giving up a crown for love or a fool falling for a twicedivorced socialite.Such an ambivalence is fitting for a film that gently introduces you to a period in British history when alliances are not clear and allegiances dangerous. One thing is patently clear, however—this is going to be on most critics best film of the year list with a sure Oscar winner for its star. If Firth missed the brass ring last year in A Single Man, hell grab it this year in Kings Speech.",False
"In my top 3 best Movies.What can I say?! One of the best movies I have ever seen. The Storyline is superb, and the acting is of the finest actors there is. Cage and Travolta deserve Oscars for their performances; how Cage changed from a murdering criminal to a determined good cop in the way he did, I will never know.Another great element of this film is the action: Guns, knives, grenade launchers, AK47s and so on! Some of the greatest gun fights I have ever seen in any movie take place here, specifically the the cop vs criminal fight in the mansion, is it? Anyway, these are just a few things I have mentioned that put this in my top 3 movies. But I must emphasise the acting once more, and how tremendous both Travolta and Cage are in this masterpiece.10/10, or in other words, brilliant!",False
"Great interpretation of a wonderful novel I saw a preview of this film yesterday and felt privileged to be one of the first people to see the film. It was also a pleasure to see a film before reading any other critical review or opinion. I am a great fan of Ian Mcewan and was concerned that it would not be possible to capture the subtleties and nuances of Mcewans writing but I neednt have had any worries. The director, Joe Wright and screenplay writer Christopher Hampton have done a superb job and the complexities of the novel are superbly captured with real imagination. The story is set in three main areas, an English country house in 1935, war torn France 1940 and London 1940. The atmosphere in of all three are wonderfully captured by the director, cinematographer, costume design and score and I am sure that there are going to be some Oscar nominations for these. James Mc Avoy as lead man gives a tremendous performance of a restrained but passionate man. I was not as convinced by Keira Knightleys performance and am not sure that her acting has the mature edge to capture the social nuances of the times that Mc Avoy did so successfully. Do not see this film if you like fast paced films and rapid plot development! This is not a film for the pop video generation. If however you like character development and a plot that unravels at a pace that allows you to be immersed in the atmosphere of the film then I can highly recommend Atonement as one of the best films that I have seen this year.",False
"Great, the village stalker  Coraline OK America, before you go blindly into an animated film with your young children, why dont you do a little research on what they are about to witness. A PG rating and stopmotion animated aesthetic do not always make a childfriendly adventure. Based upon the horror novella by acclaimed author Neil Gaiman, Henry Selicks Coraline is chockfull of heavy material, dark story threads, and bleak possibilities. For a guy like me, those things equal undivided success; for a child aged ten, those things equal nightmare filled evenings and parents writing angry letters to Focus Features for subjecting their children to lewd and horrific imagery. Well guess what parents? No one is to blame but you. Im not saying keep all youngsters away, but do use some discretion on whether your son or daughter can handle the fantastical elements. This is very much Alice in Wonderland displayed in all its non Disney possibilities. A cautionary tale on being careful what you wish for, our heroine must discover the difference between a world of people neglecting her and that of people doing all they can so that they may give her all she could ever want in the future. Life is not about getting it all right now, but instead a slow and steady climb built on love and trust, one whose benefits far outweigh the whirlwind romance that is never truly as it seems.Remember folks, this is a story that won the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers; its not all singsongy like Selicks masterpiece A Nightmare Before Christmas. With that said, however, it is very, very good in a very, very different way. Be prepared for a methodically and deliberately paced story. More psychological terror than jump out at you scares, the tale of Coraline escaping into a parallel world, perfectly mirrored of her own only inhabited by animated dolls, is one of enlightenment and discovery of what love truly means. Do we all want the parents that dote on us? The guardians that will do what we want and when we want it? Of course we do. But that idyllic utopia doesnt exist, especially in the times for which we live today. Children need to be raised and supported and that takes money and a lot of hard work. What may seem like neglect in the eyes of a child is really two people doing all they can, sacrificing their time, in order to give him/her a chance at success. Only when Coraline sees the manipulation and truth behind the kindness her Other Mother gives her does she realize what she has back at home.What we are shown is a world through a tiny door in the wall of an old triplesegmented home. There are stories about this door used to explain the disappearances of some local children, including the sister of loudmouthed and shy Wybie Lovats grandmother. Only a weathered black cat appears to know what is going on, what the too good to be true farce beyond the door is actually masking behind it. This cat can travel between worlds and therefore knows it all, allowing him to warn Coraline by orchestrating events via those she encounters. A disgruntled child is easily malleable and fooled when doted upon and given sweets and a smile. The mantra never talk to strangers is never more applicable than it is here. With something a tad offkilter in the fantasy world, Coraline finds herself shaking it off and relishing the opportunity to experience all that she had dreamed of, not knowing that if her parents succeed with their new gardening catalog, those dreams will be fulfilled in reality. Patience is a virtue and youngsters unfortunately dont learn that fact until they are all grown up, finding ways to apologize to their parents for being such confused and naïve monsters.With some very nice voiceworkDakota Fanning shines as our titular heroine; Keith Davids baritone brings the cats mixture of foreboding and help to life and Robert Bailey Jr. gets the nervous tick and stammer on the nose for Wybie, (short for Why Born, now thats a name you hope your parents never considered)you do find yourself enveloped in this world. A rare thing for an animated film to begin with a cast listing, it thankfully doesnt detract from the escapism by making you think of the actor rather than the character. This fact works best with the mother, played by Teri Hatcher. I would never have been able to pick her voice out, but that just enhances it all the more, breathing life into the stopmotion clay form on screen, becoming the wolf in sheeps clothing villain necessary for it all to work.Definitely soak in the aesthetic and intelligent storytelling as Coraline is for a thoughtful audience willing to delve deep into metaphors and hidden meaning. There is no approved for your Attention Deficit Disorder child stamp of approval here. In much the opposite direction, dont be surprised if your child hates you for making them sit through it. However, it is a tale that will resonate for a portion of the public, hitting on their own feelings of selfishness and wanting the spoils without the work. When your child is intellectually mature enough to handle a rich and deep story, you as a parent will know. When he or she can see a couple of bigbosomed, large older women dressed as mermaids with pasties and not laugh or get uncomfortable, that is when you should let them see Coraline. It is ultimately a film for all ages; one that shows you as adults how it all will get betterjunior will one day understand the sacrifices you are makingand you children a fantastical world to escape to with consequences that will shake you into the realization of what you have right in front of you at home.",False
"A masterpiece This, along with The Doom Generation, is one of my many favorite films. I remember showing this to quite a few people at different times, and two things seem to upset people the most: the bisexuality/homoeroticism and the loads of sex scenes that, depending on the scene, serve various purposes. One person I watched it with (she thought she was an intellectual and felt it was beneath her to sit through it) said there was no way this film could be saying anything important and called it a porno movie. Naturally, since this film shows not one exposed genital organ or even a bare female breast, her argument was ridiculous. As for the homosexual things that go on in the film, I think that that makes people upset because it depicts these characters as human beings with emotions (which homosexuals and bisexuals are) and/or because it turns them on. I love this movie for many reasons. Its very schizophrenic, always going back and forth from harsh realities to gutbusting humor, and sometimes managing to blend them together in a strange and equal mix. It seems that Gregg Araki was trying to defy expectations of him here, and that he was trying not to make a film easily judged as exploitation. This movie has more sex scenes than The Doom Generation, but they are not explicit at all. The reasons these scenes are erotic and entertaining is because Araki works with the characters and dialogue to make the sex interesting without showing any nudity other than the occasional male butt. Also, where there would be so many people to call The Doom Generation garbage for its constant use of obvious profanities, the dialogue in Nowhere, if youll notice, was done without hardly any cusswords, unless you count the myriad of VERY creative slang terms poured all throughout. And as for the gore, theres one big scene and one brief, minor scene. What I find amazing is that even with these differences, Nowhere is no less fascinating and brutally effective than The Doom Generation. I love them both, and, no matter how many disagree, I believe Araki is a very important, skillful, and versatile cinematic artist. Ive decided to include no spoilers, but I do want to add one more thing: If you dont see any meaning to this, that still doesnt mean that it is completely meaningless and without a point.",True
"A look at life in NY Mean Streets, the earliest Scorsese film people have heard of, is the result of an onform film maker, telling a personal story.One thing to immediately note about Mean Streets is the performance of our two leads, Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro, both looking young and are full of energy. They deliver the goods, big time. They are both so watchable and make up at least half of the movies appeal. In fact, Mean Streets is an inherently watchable movie overall, helped by some fine dialogue and Scorseses trademark energetic and involving camerawork. The main draw is the antics of the characters and their relationships rather than a highstakes narrative. Dramatic things happen but dont relate intrinsically to the central plot: that of De Niros character Johnny Boy, his debts to clubs, bars and old pals along with his longsuffering buddy Charlie (Keitel).In comparison to other Scorsese films (which is inevitably going to happen if this is not your first Scorsese), it is very low on scale and as mentioned before, low on stakes. This is no gangster epic or psychological portrait but simply a 2 hour window into the streets of New York. It is certainly worth watching.",True
"This is my favourite movie of all time...I probably never would have seen this movie if my mother hadnt persuaded me to take my little brother to see it. I enjoyed it a lot the first time, but it was only when I saw it again a couple of years later on video I realised just how superb a movie it is. Its not a clever or complex movie, its not the kind of film which works on an adult level as well as on a childrens one. However, three aspects of it make it truly great:1: The music. Under The Sea richly deserved its Oscar, but Part Of Your World deserved it even more.2. The animation. Quite simply, its absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes in particular take your breath away.3. The Story. How can you resist a love story that touching?I urge anyone with even a touch of sentimentality about them to set their predjudices aside and see this movie.",False
"Envigorating and effective masterpiece When it comes to naming the best films of the 1990s, The Talented Mr. Ripley hardly ever gets a mention. This is one of cinemas greatest mysteries; how can a film as well made, constantly intriguing and brilliantly conceived as this one constantly get passed over? And in favour of many under deserving films as well? Really strange. Almost as big a mystery as the one Ive just mentioned is the web of intrigue created here. Through deep, complex characters and situations rich with double meaning, Anthony Minghella has turned Patricia Highsmiths original novel into a cinematic masterpiece. The talented Matt Damon stars as the talented man of the title that is offered $1000 to travel to Italy to try and return Dickie; the rich and spoilt son of a millionaire. What follows is a complex, disturbing and fascinating expose of a man ingratiating himself into the lives of Dickie, his girlfriend Marge and high society on the whole...The main reason why The Talented Mr. Ripley works so well is that its central characters are deep labyrinths that beg to explored and analysed. Every scene is rich with double meaning and character interactions that exist under the surface of the drama we are seeing on screen. The character of Tom Ripley is a true masterpiece of characterisation indeed. This sociopath, that would rather be a pretend somebody than a real nobody is a myriad of contradictions and muddled personalities. His actions are always amoral and through his lies and deception, it is obvious that he doesnt care at all for anyone around him. However, despite this; we are still able to feel for him through his tribulations. The story is told in such a way that it is difficult to feel for any of the other characters and all of our sympathies lie with the talented Tom Ripley. This puts the audience in a strange situation, as were used to hating the antagonist and feeling for the protagonist, but this film turns that on its head, and to great effect.The film is helped implicitly by the fact that its one of the most professionally made films ever to make it onto the screen. Every scene, every action, every line uttered is done with the greatest assurance and nothing at all in the film appears to be there by accident or out of place. The way that the characters interact with each other and their surroundings is always believable and we never question anything that is shown on screen. Anthony Minghellas direction is more than solid, and this is helped by the stunning photography, courtesy of 1950s Italy. Many a film has benefited from Italys landscape, and this is one of them. This is all great, but its the performances that put the final finishing touch on this amazing masterclass of filmmaking. As mentioned, the talented Mr Damon takes the lead role and completely makes it his own. He often gets coupled with his friend, Ben Afleck, when it comes to acting; but this is very unfair as Damon is one of todays brightest stars. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow make up the other two leads. Im not the biggest fan of either of these two stars, but both, like Damon, give performances here that will always be associated with their personalities. Cate Blanchett has a small role, but the real plaudits for the smaller performances go to the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene hes in.The Talented Mr. Ripley is one stunning piece of film. Ignore the people that dont consider this one of the 1990s greatest achievements; they are wrong. The film is a masterpiece of tense situations, great characterisation and professional filmmaking. And I refuse to hear otherwise.",False
"Go for it. Ignore the haters. Tarantino entertainment to the core!This is a short review I am forced to write after noticing the critics and the haters. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It may be similar to his previous movies, but great directors dont come often and in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantino decides to make another Tanrantino western with all the fine work thrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is a legend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make in his lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I would still watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest. Hateful Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness, snow and that incredible eye for perfection and storytelling. Go damn watch it and be prepared to be a told a western story Tarantino style.",True
"incredibly powerful film I just saw this film at Sundance, and it was truly amazing. I confess I did not read the book (I will now), but I suspect that Daniels really took it to the next level. The story of Precious and her world was deeply moving and supremely well acted. I was particularly surprised at my own ability to laugh, along with the story, at the worst humanity can throw at us. After the film, Daniels, the producers, and the entire cast came forward to many standing ovations. Gabby was indeed charming, and I was particularly riveted by Mo Niques discussion of how she was able to become Mary, Precious mother. Daniels fielded many questions from the audience, mostly directed at the task of realizing this story. I hope to see his work again. This is a heavy film, but I highly recommend it.",False
"Watch it for the old footage, not for the publicity stunt.I am not going to talk so much about the historical part of this documentary, which indeed is great and one of the best Ive seen. I have no objections about it at all. However I dont buy this were all victims idea that the filmmakers and Marroquin are trying to portray. Its so sad that after seeing footage of the wonderful and brave leaders Rodrigo Lara Bonilla and Luis Carlos Galan you later get to see their sons sell out and in the most naive way accept Pablo Escobar juniors apology in front of the cameras, which is nothing more than a publicity stunt. Sadly Colombias now historical heroes clearsighted and firm stand against corruption and criminality werent passed on to their sons. I felt sad seeing these nice, well intentioned guys being so manipulated by the opportunistic son of Escobar, or Sebastian Marroquin as he calls himself today. There is no way neither Cano nor Galan would sell out this way had they been alive today. Marroquin also tried to reach out to other victims, such as the Cano family who wisely questioned his real intentions and backed out of it. Marroquin is a guy that several times has tried to trademark Pablos name in Colombia and abroad sells tshirts with his fathers picture on them under the ridiculous pretext that its to raise awareness and that history should never repeat itself. Thats rich. I guess with that same logic you should sell tshirts of Hitler and swastikas to support antiracism. Make no mistake about it. Marroquins biggest hero is his father and that is not something that you can combine with remorse and regret. His apology is as fake as Pablo Esobars speeches about peace in Colombia. Both Cano and Galan wouldve known that but apparently not their sons. If youre gonna see it, see it for the old footage and the interviews, not for the apology.According to the now released from prison, John Jairo Velasquez, who was a hitman for Escobar, Marroquin was trained as a kid to become a criminal and did in fact participate in placing bombs and torturing of victims. Apart from still sitting on a huge amount of his fathers dirty money. This movie he mainly did because he wanted to return to Colombia to sell some properties and arts that his father left him. Believe what you want. But this guy is not as innocent as he wants to appear.",False
"Innocent, beautiful and brilliant fun Despite the dreadful title, Moonrise Kingdom is simply wonderful. Since his flying start with Bottle Rocket and the triumph of Rushmore, I felt that Wes Anderson had rather tottered off a true path. The Royal Tenenbaums was hit and miss, The Darjeeling Limited was too twee, and The Life Aquatic was simply AWFUL. I take against ANY film that wastes Bill Murray.Moonrise Kingdom doesnt repeat that error. Despite covering ground Andersons already visited to an extent in Rushmore, MK looks at a teenage crush with fresh eyes, and surrounds it with a fantastic cast of oddballs and misfits. Unlike his films where the characters are irritatingly quirky for the sake of it, these oddballs seem organic to their strange island home. Star among them is Ed Norton as Scout Master Ward, who looks as if hes having the time of his life in shorts and woggles, in charge of a troop described as beige lunatics.Bruce Willis, Frances Mc Dormand and Bill Murray all play their parts but never feel as though theyre elbowing for the spotlight, which keeps the mood kind, befitting the hearts of all involved in the search for runaway scout, Sam, and his penpal, Suzy. Visually, its a feast of saturated colour and fabulous design, but  as with the best of Wes Anderson  the devils always in the detail. The laughs come from minutely observed accessories (keep an eye on the scouts badges!) and from throwaway truths. And the soundtrack is a great mix of wistful Western and classical pieces. Definitely buyable. Anderson flirts with surrealism, but never gets Burtonesque, controlling his story with a firmer hand and to better effect. His situations might be bizarre, but the people in them are always painfully, wonderfully human. Its also a rare film  one you could watch with your grandmother or your grandchildren, with only a couple of moments where young eyes would have to be covered, and no real violence or swearing.There is an overwhelming feeling of innocence and good will throughout.I loved it from the opening frames, and it only got better from there.",True
"Awesome Courtroom Drama A young hotshot naval lawyer (Cruise) is given what seems to be an open and shut case of two marines murdering another while he slept. Cruise, who has a reputation for plea bargaining was assigned by division, to defend the accused. Could it be so it never sees the inside of a courtroom? Over seeing the defence of the accused is Demi Moore, from internal affairs, who is renowned for her attention to detail. She believes their innocence and suspects a cover up.In charge of the marine unit in question is Jack Nicholson, a hardass marine who commands respect and demands the best.With outstanding performances from Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, and Yes Demi Moore as well.

"Not perfect but close. Heres why.There is something about this movie that captures you. It starts out quirky and comedic, but as the film progresses it becomes more serious. The ensemble cast gives it the feeling of a classic like Snatch, but this isnt an just an action film. It is more dramatic and you do feel for some of the characters. The movie does have some faults like some predictable plot points and the humor fails at some parts, but this shouldnt discourage you from watching the film. It is worth the price of the ticket. Seven Psychopaths is one of the better movies to come out this season. It doesnt disappoint. Its a great flick to go out with the guys. Colin Farell (hope I spelled it right, sorry Colin) adds another great performance to his belt.",True
"Very powerfull statement against drugs.I think The basketball diaries is a realistic and very important movie. It shows the road that one walks to being addicted to drugs. From taking dope once a week to taking dope every day, every hour. Leonardo Di Caprio playes a basketballplayer, a schoolkid(Jim Carrol) who walks this path. He experiments with drugs till there is no way back. He gets himself in all kinds of stupid situations. He starts robbing stores, ripping off money from old ladies just to get some cash for dope. His life is beginning to look like a living hell. His basketballcoach wants to have sex with him, and when he passes out on the basketballfield due to taking a wrong kind of peppil, he gets kicked out of the basketball team and from school. From this moment on everything goes in a downward spiral for Di Caprio.An excellent scenario you would say, and it is. The acting from Di Caprio is great. We saw it earlier on in his career when he got oscarnominated for Whats eating gilbert grape. A gripping drama in which he playes a disabled kid. But in The basketball diaries he playes an equally difficult part. Not a lot actors would have put down this kid whos life is wrecked, and who is constantly thinking about dope as well as Di Caprio did.The statement the movie delivers is a powerfull one. Being addicted to drugs is horrible. Usually people learn about this aspect trough seminars or televisonshows such as Oprah Winfrey. But it never really gets the kind of attention and understanding from the audience as The Basketball diaries delivers.The amazing performance by Di Caprio, the fact that this movie is actually based on a true story and the reality the movie is set in, The basketball diaries deserves a 9 out of 10.",True
"Volatile Redemption Crash is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode.The complexity of the film comes from the encounters between characters and their tangled lives and worlds. Haggis screenplay is so intricate and delicately written I couldnt begin to try to summarize the actual plot line (which destines this article to be kind of vague), but everyone meets everyone else at some point in the film (and there are a whole lot of characters). Sufficed to say these meetings are variably intense, casual, fleeting, dangerous, but they all effect the participants in profound and provocative ways, causing lives to find enlightenment or swerve violently, and watching it all unfold is mesmerizing because Paul Haggis (Oscar Nominated writer of Million Dollar Baby) made the film meaty with messy characters and topics and stories to chew and hurtle along with.The allencompassing theme of the film is racism, and it is dealt with bluntly, honestly, and without reservation. Every single character participates in the perpetuation of the ugly cycle but also suffers because of it. Where racism makes for an interesting enough subject for an already provoking and fairly experimental film (I was surprised to see this get wide release), its only the catalyst for a deeper, resounding story of redemption and the universality of our lonely situation which the movie becomes during its second hour (what you could call Act II). It switches from a somewhat depressing contemplative amalgamation of moments about racism in everyday life and how destructive it is, to a throbbing, intense web of choices and consequences  life and death, vivifying or soul killing  and the chance at redemption.Following their actions in Act I, everyone meets a fork in the road or is given a second chance of some sort. Some take it, some dont, but regardless, by the end of the movie everyone has changed. This is what gives the movie wings during its second hour, makes it interesting, keeps you guessing and on knifesedge. It also gives the characters depth and souls and shows that despite perceived and upheld differences, when it comes down to it we arent different (which we see in a shattering scene between Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate after Tate notices that he and Philippe have the same St. Christopher statue), in fact we desperately need each other. Its one of the few films Ive seen where everyone is at fault somehow and yet there are no villains. It makes it hopeful, particularly with something as ugly as racism: everyones fallible, but everyone has the capacity for good and nobility. That said, each of these characters inner struggles makes for all the conflict and resolution you need.A talented ensemble drives the film, sharing almost equal amounts of screen time, but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard (plays a TV director), Matt Dillon (as a patrol cop), Sandra Bullock (a rich housewife), , Don Cheadle (a detective), and Michael Peña (a locksmith). These five gave deeply, deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations, giving souls  alone, yearning, and searching in a world that doesnt seem to care  to shells of imperfect people. But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact: a glance, an embrace, a pause, a smile, a wince, things that breath the film to life and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her maid after shes begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her, but her own life.Some closing notes: its obvious its a debut. At times the dialogue and acting can be stilted and unnatural; some of the initial racial situations seem forced; certain scenes could have used some editing or fine tuning, but by the end I didnt care. It also may be helpful to know that the first hour spends its time setting everything up for Act II, although it will seem more like a photo essay on racism than a setup. But by the time Act I ends youre ready for something substantial to happen, and at the perfect moment, stuff happens. I was entirely satisfied with this movie, I couldnt have asked for anything more. Still its impressive, with his debut Haggis made a film that magically maintains a storytelling balancing act about peoples lives that almost seamlessly flows, takes an honest look at racism with an understanding of mankind, a belief in redemption, and even hope. As I walked out of the theater into the rainy night it resonated with me and colored my thoughts as I made my way through the crowds of unknown fellow people filling the cinema. Thats about all I can ask for in a film.",False
"Unbelievable.Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think thats what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as Im concerned this is the top film of alltime and definitely deserves a watch if you havent seen it.",True
"Terrific adaptation that stands on its own.I saw a preview screening of Dreamgirls on Nov. 15. and have to say I was pretty blown away by it. I can always tell when a movie really hits me because the thought immediately runs through my head, Wow, I cant wait to OWN this on DVD. Needless to say, Dreamgirls is now at the top of my To Buy list.I saw the original Michael Bennett production in 1985, a few years into its Broadway run when Jennifer Holliday was no longer in the Effie role. But even without Holliday I found the show and its score to be among Broadways best. While I certainly hoped this movie would at least give us a respectable representation of what made the Broadway show so thrilling, I must admit I was afraid to get my expectations too high after the recent string of disappointing stage to screen musical transfers  Phantom of the Opera, Rent and The Producers. Yeah, I had heard the buzz was good for Dreamgirls, but, well, you know how that goes. Sometimes the bigger the buzz the flatter it falls.And lets face it. Movie musicals are just flatout tough to pull off. While I consider the number of truly great movies to be pretty small, the list of truly great movie MUSICALS is even smaller. And the ones that manage to do more than just recreate a literal adaptation of the stage play, truly utilizing the medium of film to create something bold and cinematic are almost non existent: Cabaret, Chicago...maybe one or two others...end of story. Plus, I think its even more difficult to successfully transfer musicals to film today given modern audiences inability to accept characters breaking into song.So I hope Im not adding to the already extensive hype when I report that, for me at least, Dreamgirls delivers big time. The film manages to achieve the near impossible task of remaining faithful to its source material (in fact, several times it gives direct nods to Bennetts brilliant original staging) while utilizing the medium of film to its fullest, creating something fresh and exciting in its own right. Dreamgirls not only transitions seamlessly between spoken dialog and musical numbers, but redefines musical storytelling by using the musical artifice of breaking into song carefully and judiciously to punctuate only those moments in the movie when the emotion builds to the point where words can no longer adequately contain it. I cant express strongly enough how impressed I was with the way Bill Condon managed to handle these transitions. Truly masterful. But its not just the transitions that are handled well. The movie is artfully rendered and exquisitely produced in literally every area with outstanding, heartfelt performances by each and every cast member. And yes, Jennifer Hudson is as good as they say. I can honestly say that theres no way I can imagine this film being done any better. If theres any weak spot in Dreamgirls, its the dramatic flaws inherent in the piece itself. The second act of the stage play (after and Im telling you Im not going) was never quite as dramatically intense or focused as the first. And the movie feels pretty much the same way. But, believe me, this is a minor flaw compared to whats RIGHT about Dreamgirls. Make no mistake. This film is going to be a triumph and earn a place in movie history. Not to mention my DVD library.",False
"Poignant and powerful Nineteen ninetynine was an outstanding year for adaptations of major literary works, but of all the great books that came to the screen last year, this is my favorite.  John Irvings novel and adaptation is one of the most complete stories I can remember in many years.  It is poignant, exhilarating, and astutely human in its scope, presenting a myriad of human emotions and experiences.Often, when a story attempts to cross genres so broadly, it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or director to meet the variable demands of such a wideranging treatment.  This film was a comedy, a tragedy, a romance, a humaninterest story, a character study, and a period piece, and each element was excellently done.This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works.  Irving weaves a strong moral into this story; that rules need to be questioned and that being human is not so easily codified.  He revisits this theme repeatedly, with each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.If there is one thing that stands out about this story, it is its human realism.  These are ordinary people struggling with problems we all face. We come to have affection for almost all of them, and can identify with their tribulations.  Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic, it reminds us that life is complicated and doesnt always turn out the way we plan or hope. From a filmmaking perspective, we could not have asked more from Lasse Hallstrom.  Known most in the U.S. for his direction of Whats Eating Gilbert Grape, Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe for almost twenty years.  However, this film will certainly go down as his finest work.  In the featurette on the DVD, he said that when he goes to Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf, he will have a feeling of pride; and well he should.This motion picture was beautifully filmed with rich cinematography, breathtaking locations, and precise period props and costumes.  However, the greatest achievement for Hallstrom, working in concert with Irving, was to orchestrate a large cast in such a way that no character seemed insignificant.  Hallstrom took great care to do enough development of each character (often just visually without any dialogue) that he made us care for each of them.  He gave the film an emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours.  His work with the children in the orphanage was superb, bringing forth their innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.The acting was uniformly outstanding.  Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right combination of idealism, naiveté and inner strength to make him an unassuming but powerful lead.  Charlize Theron continues to impress me with her acting ability.  Besides her enchanting girlnextdoor attractiveness, she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow, but later proved to be quite complex.Michael Caine has had a legendary career spanning close to half a century. He has long been one of my favorite actors.  His performance here was powerful and well deserving of the acclaim he received.  Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character; egotistical, selfabusive, manipulative and recalcitrant, yet a saintly, selfsacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children.  Caines ability to span that range was remarkable.Finally, I have the highest praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, the orchard foreman.  Lindos bright smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm, strength and simple wisdom.  He captures our admiration immediately, and despite his despicable act, we cannot help but pity him in the end.After having seen all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last year, I have to say that this was my personal favorite.  It wasnt as flashy as the rest; in fact, this was downright old fashioned in its approach.  They just dont write stories like this anymore, and thats a shame.  I rated it a 10/10.  In its quiet way, it captured my heart.",False
"The Glorious (500) Days of Summer Lets face it. Weve all done our share of dumping. Whether its the, Lets just be friends, or the all too familiar, Its not you, its me, tactic, as long as youre not on the receiving end it becomes a question of, How quickly can I get this over with, so I can move on with my life? Equally, all of us (yes even Brad Pitt) have experienced what it feels like to be dumped and the complex emotions that unexpectedly follow. If youre one of the fortunate souls that have managed to escape the throws of relationship hell, youll probably fare better with renting the newest addition to the Rambo series. For the rest of you whove at one time or another gotten your hearts ripped out of your chests and stomped into a million pieces only to turn you into unshaven, alcoholic hermits on the brink of starvationthis movie is dedicated to you. Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a wannabe architect turned professional greeting card writer whose life is thrown for a loop when he suddenly falls for the new girl Summer (Zooey Deschanel, Almost Famous). As one who appeared most certainly unattainable at first glance, Tom manages to charm her into what she coins as a, casual relationship. Eventually, Tom ends up questioning their status with one another, which manages to put strain on the relationship, causing her to request the dreaded time apart. (500) Days of Summer chronicles the bitter sweet beginnings, the untimely endings and all of that confusing stuff that takes place during the in betweens of a relationship that just isnt meant to be.(500) Days of Summer is presented in an effective nonlinear style that sets it apart from its romantic comedy predecessors, rotating back and forth between dates signified by a simple title card flashing in between scenes (2), (50), (150) and so on to represent the various days in the course of Toms roller coaster of a relationship. This seesaw method of bouncing to and fro successfully manages to force the viewer in a physically engaging shared experience of Toms feelings, which is something every director aspires to elicit from their intended audience. The real kudos go to Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, whose script is practically flawless. You cant help but feel that their authenticity and attention to detail while constructing each scene through appropriately sarcastic and funny dialogue exchanges among all of the main characters involved, particularly those between Deschanel and Levitt which come across as heartbreakingly real and genuine. Their creative way of crafting the simple concept of a break up through unconventional story structuring is a refreshing concept that begs to be seen more in a world where most conventional films tend to play it safe. Leads Deschanel and Levitt manage to bring something quite special to the screen in their portrayals of Tom and Summer (both last nameless). Their chemistry is really what makes the film a joy to watch. Mostly thanks to Neustadter and Webers superb dialog, both actors seem so comfortable in their roles that their interactions with one another transcend the screen and naturally unfold before our eyes as if we were voyeurs to their unraveling, wanting so much to change the fate of their outcome, but helpless to do so. Deschanel is sexy, carefree and bound to be adored by males everywhere as Summer. Levitt captures the struggle of the neurotic boy in love exceptionally through all of his various stages of emotional imbalance. (500) Days of Summer is a poem to every down and out guy who thinks hes the only one whose ever been dragged through the mill by their own Summer. What undoubtedly ends up making this picture so brilliant is how relatable it is to its victims and victimizers a like. When all is said and done, there is most definitely a lesson to be learned by Toms experiences. Everyone you meet along the way, whether just passing through or sticking around for awhile, has a purpose. In the end nothing lasts forever, relationships begin, relationships end. Try to be thankful for all the people that broke your heart, they more than likely helped you find yourself in the process especially you, Summerbitch.",True
"A comedy? Really??It is by far the worst movie I have seen this year. And I seriously do not understand why is it labeled as a comedy? 80% of the movie it is plain sad. A sad sad movie, about a girl who is miserable. She is lonely, broke, and is loosing her childhood best friend. Between a series of humiliating situations the director decided to add some jokes, or situational gags. I have to admit, a couple of them were funny. But apart from those, we get 2 hours and 10 minutes of a woman being miserable. She is more miserable than Dr. House during hist stay in the mental hospital and after Cuddy dumped him put together.The only good thing about this the role played by Chris O Dowd, who is funny and convincing. Too bad, there is only about 25 minutes of him in that 2 hour 10 minutes worth of continuing sadness and misery.",False
"very beautiful movie with awesome performances!What a beautiful story it was, a sad story of that girl Ewa, full of hope arriving in a strange country with the believe that she and her sister will be welcomed by their family! And the desperation and fear when bit by bit her hope and faith gets challenged by the bitterness of the American dream, the bitterness of being immigrants without money or relatives, connections... Marion is amazing, she acts with her eyes, her face tells it all, she actually doesnt need words... She makes Ewa a very fragile looking girl but with an amazing survivalinstinct .. Joacquin was charming, frightening, sad, and at the end pitiful..a very dark character, despicable and yet tragic... When Jeremy comes into the story, his character adds a lot of tension with great interaction with Joacquin and Marion; repressed emotions, boyish charm , impulsiveness combined with darkness. He was really really excellent, I loved his performance.. Gray did an awesome job by building up the story the way he did, with very beautiful images, images in those amazing soft yellow ocher colors , that show us a world of those who are damned  with very rare beacons of light...

"A noir masterpiece, possibly even a timeless classic...While I dont care too much for Roman Polanskis style of direction(maybe Ill grow to like it eventually, maybe not), I cant deny that this is a truly great film. Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it, perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, that hed make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, it was flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are wellwritten and credible. The special effects are welldone and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very wellwritten and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. The cinematography is good, and even when the plot doesnt move a lot, Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background, while were focusing on whats directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesnt possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good, and they come as surprises... I dont think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be that impressive, but the story stands on its own nicely as well. This is a great movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it(its more than just casually adult in nature, even though theres not that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailormade for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanskis direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 10/10",True
"Spellbinding Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowskis script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis.

"A sleek, expensive and obedient skinjob Blade Runner (1982) was a happy (yet gloomy) accident, involving: a) a young and ambitious director who fought ferociously with studio executives in order for them to let him fulfill his vision; b) a rising blockbuster star who wanted to prove he can also act in a serious movie; c) a crazy Dutch actor who decided to change the script and improvise one of the most memorable monologues in film history; d) a bunch of talented artists who wanted to make a movie that would look and sound different from anything else we had seen before. And most of all, e) a post Vietnam turbulent era when Hollywood rebels like Coppola, Scorsese and Cimino were audaciously attempting to reinvent the language of cinema, telling stories that mattered and not caring at all about target audiences and marketing trends. As a result, Blade Runner was a box office failure that slowly became a legend, breaking stereotypes like good guy kills bad guy at the end and dealing with existential agony on an almost metaphysical level; always within the context of a gritty corporate dystopia in the near future.Blade Runner 2049 is none of these things. On the contrary, its the flawed triumph of a next generation of studio executives, who control the creative process by paying millions to the industrys best of the best, providing they will make something that will take advantage of a successful brand name in order to bring profits to shareholders. If there is one word to describe this movie, its replicant. Not the kind of replicant who realizes that all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain as he dies, but a sleek, expensive and obedient skinjob that will try to entertain you and if it succeeds will return as a sequel that will eventually become yet another franchise. I spent 160 minutes of my life watching a pleasant and perfectly constructed piece of nothing, and I didnt care for a moment about any of the characters or a storyline that was designed without the intention to question and redefine a single thing. All its moments have already been lost in my memory, while the original Blade Runner remains vivid in my mind, as if I only saw it yesterday.",False
"I Do Not Choose To Be a Common Man The Disaster Artist (2017 release; 103 min.) brings the reallife story of how the 2003 cult movie The Room got made. As the movie opens, a number of current day movie stars, including Kirsten Bell, Adam Scott. J.J. Abrams and others gush about the virtues of this so bad, that its so good movie. We then shift to San Francisco, July 13, 1998 when Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero meet at an acting class and strike up a friendship. Later that year, they decide on w him to move to Los Angeles, where Tommy somehow has kept an apartment. Tommy and Greg pursue their dream of becoming an actor (inspired by James Dean, among others), but when its becoming clear that nobody wants to do anything with them, they decide to make their own film... At this point, we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love primarily by James Franco, who directs, coproduces, and stars as Tommy. His brother Dave costars as Greg. The real life story is so beyond anything believable that if this were a work of fiction, it would immediately be dismissed as just that. Let me state upfront that I have not seen The Room (although I see it frequently listed as a midnight listing at my local arthouse theater). From everything we witness in The Disaster Artist, Tommy is so incredibly inapt yet convinced of his own talent, it reminds me of those American Idol auditions back in the day where certain contestants think they are super good yet they were horrible. Another similarity is the Meryl Streep movie Florence Foster Jenkins (about a real life wealthy NY socialite who thinks she sings well and nobody dares to contradict her, leading to a notorious Carnegie Hall concert). James Franco does an outstanding job in the lead role, and Im going to predict that he will get a number of nominations in the upcoming awards season. It isnt until the very end of the movie (when scenes from the original The Room are played in parallel with the recreated scenes for The Disaster Artist) that one gets a sense how incredibly meticulous Franco has been in recreating them down to the last detail. Absolutely amazing. Last but certainly not least, the movie features a bunch of other wellknown performers, some of them in very noticeable roles (such as Seth Rogen and Alison Brie), and others in blink and youll miss it roles (such as Sharon Stone, Zoey Deutch, Zac Efron, etc.). In an early scene of the movie, when Tommy and Greg become unlikely friends, they head over to Tommys place, and Greg notices a prominent sign on the apartments wall: I Do Not Choose To Be a Common Man. Whatever you think of Tommy, he certainly is not your common man!The Disaster Artist opened this weekend at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens (a rarity). The Friday evening screening where i saw this at was attended very nicely, I;m happy to report. The audience roared with laughter on many occasions. The positive wordofmouth this movie surely will generate makes it likely to have long legs at the box office (at least within the arthouse theater circuit). If you are in the mood for something truly different, I encourage you to check out The Disaster Artist, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Bluray.",True
"Great film Australia is one of the greatest films ever made. It has everything that made great movies such as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago: An epic plot, great performances, and lots of beautiful and memorable scenes.Australia is simply one of the greatest movie that Ive ever saw, along with Avatar from James Cameron. I cant believe that such a great film like this received so many bad reviews, while horrible, and overrated films like The Expendables receive a lot of hype and praise.Australia was a great film, filled with lots of emotions: It has romance, comedy, drama and excitement. It is easily one of the greatest films ever made, and definitely it deserves a lot of more appreciation.I cant believe that this film wasnt nominated at the category for best picture...Now, thats unfair.",False
"With tracking down Like an AA meeting: disjointed, funny, moving, boring, inspiring and, ultimately, rewarding.The actors are mesmerising. Joaquin Phoenix recovers nicely here from his misstep with Mary Magdalene but its Jonah Hill as the sage gay sponsor who steals the film with a subtle portrayal imbued with nonchalant spirituality. Rock stars Kim Gordon (Sonic Youth) and Beth Ditto (Gossip) make appearances and Ditto turns in a solid gold performance that left me hoping shell continue down the acting path.Despite being overlong and bogged down with unnecessarily complicated timeline, the overall film moved me and made me glad I got past the clunky title and misleading romcom poster.",True
"A stupefying, wtf? movie, which puts fictional thrillers to shame Considered a deadcert win at the Academy Awards next year, Bart Laytons documentary The Imposter has rapidly generated a great deal of notoriety and acclaim. The quintessential stranger than fiction tale, its sensational blend of archive footage, delicate reconstructions and heartrending talking head interviews illustrate that, not only is Layton a masterful, investigative reporter, but moreover a profoundly impressive storyteller.Back in 1994, the bluecollar Barclay family from San Antonio, Texas, was left distraught after the disappearance of their 13yearold son, Nicholas. Like any teenage boy, Nicholas was a cocksure kid, filled with energy, love for his family, and certainly wouldnt runaway from home for no good reason. Weeks turned into months, and eventually the case was abandoned by the police and press. Three years later, the local Texas police department receives an international call from Spain. On the receiving end is a character claiming to be Nicholas. Putting in a bogus story about how he escaped the clutches of a drug fuelled, pedophilic organization, the police think his story check out, and soon enough Nicholas sister Carey jets over to Europe to meet her long lost brother. In front of police officials, she takes a good look and identifies him as the legitimate lost brother. Three years ago, Nicholas was a blueeyed, spunky American teenager, now hes transformed into a dark haired, browneyed man with stubble and an irreplaceable French accent.The Imposter, like its central subject, is not the documentary you expect it to be. With many twists, contortions and moral judgements, your pretty much openmouth and on the edge of your seat throughout the films entirety. Thats partly down to Laytons craft, particularly the Errol Morrislike interviewing technique – which sees people gaze directly into the lens of the camera and, vicariously, straight at us. But, even more astounding, is the capricious performer that names the film. Frédéric Bourdin, a then 23yearold man of French Algerian descent, is actively impersonating Nicholas the whole time, convincing not only the state officials, but the abandoned boys own mother. With a shrouded history as a homeless orphan thrown into the life of deception and petty crime, he longed to fit in and have a family of his own. When that opportunity didnt surface, he decided to steal Nicholass own.How could he get away with it? I hear you cry. Thats something Ill leave for you to answer when you see this documentary. Suffice to say, Bourdin is an intimidatingly convincing, intelligent and charismatic figure. To the point where we sit back and reflect whether we could have been swung by his quick wit. Even if Bourdin is the great pretender, a new revelation in the films final act suggests that the Barclay family are perhaps keeping up appearances of their own.It may not be my favourite documentary of the year (The Act of Killing, if you were wondering), but The Imposter is the best psychological thriller Ive seen in recent memory. It transcends the documentary stratum. A dauntingly universal account of a missing child and false identity, its stupefying moments will leave you silenced whilst the movie plays out. But, as soon as the credits roll, youll be talking about this exceptional movie for years to come.Read more reviews at: http://www.366movies.com",False
"Disappointing and Dreary This film was very highly rated by the jury of the Heartland Film Festival, an annual event here in Indianapolis, and I was eager to see it. To say I found it disappointing is an understatement.The opening scene of a corn snake slowly swallowing a rather large fish is a good foreshadowing of what the filmmaker requires of his audience. We are being offered an Art Film with a big capital A. Do we really need yet another film exploring the emotional trials of young white American boys? Perhaps if I had not just seen two major release films dealing with similar material in the last 6 months the excellent Mud and the pretty good Boys of Summer I might have had a little more patience with mining this material for fresh insights. The scene where the brothers are introduced to us, at the lake, was promising, though enigmatic. What is their relationship to each other? Is the older boy sexually abusing the younger? The shot of their silhouettes from the rear, where Eric puts on his shirt, and Tommy removes his was a beautiful moment. It was downhill from there. The acting in the scenes in the abandoned house was awkward, and the boys behavior unnatural. For instance, when Tommy watches Ian playing with the cicada shell he brought home from the abandoned house and asks him what is is, Ian does not reply. I cannot imagine a boy not responding to a direct question like that. I was trying to buy in at this point and waited for the film to hit its stride, but it never did. The consequences of Ians death were not depicted in a realistic way, which contradicts the whole point of this supposedly lifelike film. More information about Ians father and Eric & Tommys parents would have given the viewer a better understanding of their motivation. There was no sympathy for Ians father, and the idea that he was either abusive or an alcoholic was never substantiated. The most engaging character in the film was Daisy, the dog. All the characters milled about in lifeless, disconnected pantomimes of real people. The introduction of the gun into the narrative was trite, simplistic,overused. Unnecessary. Mr. Carbone, couldnt you think of a more creative device to heighten the tension? So the film dragged on, the leaves blew, the water rustled, the rain came and the seasons changed. Nothing was resolved, and there was no transformation as the cicada implied. I could have used a Barforama scene or a character like Neckbone to relieve the unrelenting tension.In the Q & A session that followed the screening, opinions were mixed, and several people left during the movie. Those who liked the movie lauded its attention to detail, the fabulous cinematography and absolute realism of the characters. I felt like they were describing a film I didnt see!",True
"I put a spell on you...Stranger Than Paradise, which put filmmaker Jim Jarmusch on the map in the small but superlative crop of independent filmmakers of the eighties (he was the first, then came the Coen Brothers, then Spike Lee, and then culminating in the 90s with the new wave of independent filmmakers). What he presents here is a unique little treatise on youth, on the subtle and disconnected qualities that go in life when you dont have much to do. In a way its an existentialist film without many very serious questions to deal with story or even characterwise (except until maybe the last fifteen minutes in the Paradise segment). Like a French New Wave film, to which Jarmusch was heavily influenced by (i.e. the gorgeous, grainy black and white photography by Tom Di Cillo), he leaves more for the audience to ponder, as they go along on their journey.One of the things that Stranger Than Paradise has going for it is a sort of realism that, like and notlike a Wes Anderson film for example, is offbeat. Only here it is more of an urban sort of landscape and interiors that Jarmusch gives us with, along with its three principles. John Lurie as Willie is very good at having attitude when he needs it, but in reality is rather lowkey in his hipness. His cousin from Hungary pays him a visit (Eszter Balint as Eva, maybe too lowkey at times, though appropriately observant of foreign territory). There is also his faithful companion Eddie, played in a great supporting tone and style by Richard Edson. The first segment of the film deals with her in New York. The second one has Eddie and Willie go to Cleveland to pay Eva a visit. Then in the third segment they go down to Florida to have some fun, only to have anything but.In other words, those looking for a film where a lot of things happen may be disappointed, or just bored. Ive seen the film twice now, and on the first viewing I was a little detached from what was going on on screen, which is just little things going on with the characters, like one would see in everyday life. But on the second viewing I somehow connected more with these characters, the youth that seem to drift needlessly along. The editing of the film is also the most simplistic, though highly effective, in adding to the disconnected quality of Jarmuschs direction no cuts during dialog, just fading to black, fading up, fading to black, fading up (Jarmusch would continue this with Down by Law and Dead Man, though not as frequent or strategic).In fact, the whole film is rather deliberate in its style, but as the song that plays several times in the film I Put a Spell On You from Screamin Jay Hawkins plays, it does work to bring a viewer in...or not. Like many in the artfilm world, almost all of Jarmuschs films are either liked or not, and I think thats appropriate for his stories, which often deal with lowkey characters dealing with unusual but either realistic or metaphorical situations. One thing I can say for certain, much like the French newwave films inspired by it, its imitated, but not equaled in its form.",False
"Daniels Messes Up Any Chance it Had After the emotional kick in the gut with Precious, one may go into The Paperboy anticipating something of a roller coaster ride from Lee Daniels and the talented cast, but The Paperboy isnt Precious by any means. The quality of the film itself is so crummy, its a wonder this high profile cast was attracted to it. Through all the cheesy and trashy aspects of the film, The Paperboy at least pushes the boundaries of what we expect and creates some shocking scenes in its plot.The screenplay does have a fairly intriguing plot, its bites off a lot of issues to talk about, but never fully realizes any of them. Sometimes the issues are so thin, they slide right by the viewer. The most fun for the viewer is to watch the interaction between Zac Efron and Nicole Kidmans characters. Its an usual romantic relationship. Everything unusual is what The Paperboy has going for its screenplay. The script does develop the characters fairly well, some of the characters more than others.The acting is the saving grace of The Paperboy and is what makes it watchable. Though John Cusack doesnt convince us in his juicy role, the rest of the cast is good. Zac Efron is decent in his protagonist role, Matthew Mc Conaughey does fairly good work, but the true star is Nicole Kidman. Its a role that requires a lot of courage. The actress who had to play Charlotte would had to embarrass herself completely; Kidman owns that and brings the character out through those humiliating moments. Lee Daniels is the man who screwed the project up. It was never destined to be a groundbreaking film, but Daniels holds it back from being at least decent as a movie. It becomes campy, has stereotypical racism, and messy scenes drowning in disarray. The narrative isnt strong enough to overcome Danielss misdirection, even with the cast trying their best.

"Ang Lee Nails It!If you want to have a real sense of the concert and the mass of young people who attended, as a crowd, by all means check out Woodstock from 1970. Its all there, the music, the rain and mud, the buzz on the soundtrack replicating the buzz on the sound system at Yasgurs Farm.But if you want to get a feeling of what Woodstock meant on a personal level, then Ang Lees your man and youve come to the right place.How Lee managed to film this recreation without using real footage, I have no idea. Thats apparently what he did.There in a number of shots is the hillside, mud and slop, with the stage below. The few food stands and portable johns at the top of the hill. The winding pathways through the side venues of jewelry, art, a class for this and a political table for that. The long narrow road that still leads off of New York State Route 17B to the Yasgur hillside where it happened.It rained a lot, but there was sun, this was mid August and Lee bathes us in the warm glow of peace. Especially true to the event as I remember, the state cop who returns a peace gesture, the locals making sandwiches and offering water from hoses.Everyone who was there and lucid has a personal remembrance. Mine began on Friday evening with air mattresses not more than 50 feet from the stage and ended with the sacrifice of a blanket abandoned on the mudslide the hill had become by early Sunday morning. In between, I managed to shuttle down state route 55 and into New Jersey the back way, after the music ended Friday night, Saturday morning. Then back from New Jersey up the same road and finally ending about two miles the other side of the concert where the vehicle stayed untouched until it was reclaimed near dawn on Sunday.By that time, all though Id only had a few generous puffs of weed, freely offered by those who had some, I was hearing double and it was time to pack it in.Yes, the brown acid warnings from Chip Monck (name?), the event voice echod in the acid trip of Demetri Martin, the young son who blunders into inviting the event to White Lake. The colors and details are incredible as seen from his eyes, slowly beginning to shift and then expanding until the hillside is undulating in waves around the lit stage below. A remarkable shot.Martin wont win any academy awards; Imelda Staunton might for her portrayal of his paranoid Jewish mother who has hidden a fortune while her rundown motel is nearing foreclosure. And an honorable mention should go to Liev Schreiber as the crossdressing former Marine who provides security at the motel.Stereotypes? Sure. Few hippies ever were as mentally vacant as the Earthlite players. Did anyone buy Emile Hirschs early post Vietnam anguish? Fortunately, it was left on the doorstep of the main film and Hirschs character later rings true. Just a high school buddy come home.But see the film for its personal feel, very true to the event. The wish that Dylan would arrive. The helicopter flights to the medical tent. (only a small number of halfamillion needed any treatment at all.) The question, what about the boys in Vietnam. As one girl says on 17B, Wish they were here. I was back just a little more than a week. Went with an Army buddy Id never see again. Yet no one gave us grief for our short hair, mandatory to get out of Vietnam.The music? Well, Arthur Lee and Love are the perfect accompaniment to the acid trip inside the bus (they never played at the festival.) When the early strains of Friday nights music begin to waft over an idyllic lake where dozens of kids bathe nude, its Arlo Guthrie and I caught myself thinking, damn, it was dark when Guthrie appeared. But that was forty years ago and the memory cant be trusted.Just the personal feeling. And despite some of the weaknesses in the subplot, Ang Lee did get the feeling right.For the personal memories, he absolutely nailed it!",False
"Must see mystery!I just saw this wonderful film at the San Francisco Film Festival as a surprise entry. Beautifully shot and realized, it keeps you guessing until the end as to the true outcome. It was throughly entertaining and innovative. This movie has it all: romance, suspense, star crossed lovers and supernatural illusions. Edward Norton is perfectly cast as Eisenheim The Illusionist. His accent flowed seamlessly and he simply disappeared into the role. The real revelation to me was none other than Paul Giamatti. Pauls richly accented role was not altogether unlike Tommy Lee Jones role in The Fugitive. I found his scenes with Norton full of respect and begrudging admiration. It was an absolute joy to see these two pros at work. I will definitely be paying to see this one again when its released theatrically.",False

It was well worth it to see that lap dance. Ferlito was clearly the star of this film.Then there were the badass girls: Tracie Thoms as Kim and Rosario Dawson as Abernathy. I could watch them ride around in a car for an hour anytime.It was the last third of the film where the action was ramped with some fantastic stunt work by badass Zoe Bell and, of course, the coup de grâce, Abernathys boot in Stuntman Mikes (Kurt Russell) face.

"An amazing and magical movie How to summarize this movie? How does one write about the magic you experienced? I do not know where to begin. The movie took me by storm, it was so fantastically wellmade, colors, scenes, it captured one and brought one back to 1930 century magical, but oh so dark circus life. Robert impressed in his role and enchanted me once again. By his side was Reese as spectacular as she always is, beautiful, seductive and fragile. Their forbidden love and passion was captivating. But the movies big star in my opinion was Rosie, the stunning elephant. Could not help but to wish for my own Rosie.The movie was wonderful in every way, romance, passion, action, tragedy, joy, yes, everything you can imagine.

"The Counselor is so in love with itself that it gives no one else a reason to love it, let alone care.The Counselor is one of the most bizarre movies Ive ever seen. Ever since it came out I was intrigued how it got very mixed reviews when it had such an amazing cast and crew. But now I know. Ill start with the positives because there actually is plenty to like in this movie. The acting first and foremost is phenomenal, particularly Fassbender and Bardem. Its the only reason you care about anything thats happening. The directing is slick and stylish, and there are a few scenes that are actually brilliant to see unfold. Some lines of dialogue are powerful. Cameron Diaz was good. Im already running out of positive things to say so lets get right into it.This movie is a hot mess. There are a hundred characters in this damn thing, its over 2 hours long when it shouldnt have been, every scene couldve been cut in half and the movie wouldve been all the better for it. Its hard to keep up with all the crap going on because its so scatterbrained in its storytelling. And thats weird to say because Bardems character tells some really captivating and hilarious stories. But the movie itself is so wordy and selfindulgent that even if you want to keep up with everything thats happening, theres no good reason to. Its an exercise in tedium after a while. Its like the writer said, Lets see how many words I can squeeze into this scene before the audience has no idea what the f*ck its about, and he did that for every damn scene. And again, there are glimmers of brilliance, hell the actual story is really interesting, but goddamn that just makes it all the more frustrating.The plot can be boiled down to a lawyer getting himself in a bad situation with drug guys and how he tries to get out of it. It sounds like a focused plot, but the movie complicates it beyond comprehension. One minute Im totally entranced by whats happening on screen, anxiously awaiting whats going to happen next, and then the movie will jump to a scene with random characters weve never seen before talking about nonsense, and they just keep talking and talking until I forget what I was entranced with in the first place. Seriously, if every scene in the movie was cut in half, it could be an excellent crime thriller. There are some truly brutal moments in the movie, and some thoughtprovoking ones, but they get stretched out and morphed to the point of bewilderment. Some of the lines in this movie are cringeworthy. Like, did they really have to repeat what the other person said in five different ways? No? Thats what I thought. And thats why this movie pisses me off.The Counselor will definitely impress some people. If you can handle an absolute clusterf*ck of a movie with a few amazing scenes and superb acting then youll probably enjoy it. But even that makes it sound better than it is, because the great scenes are so few and far between youre left thinking, Why on earth did they go in this direction? They had something great here! Its a baffling movie, really, and the more I think about it the more it upsets me because of how great it couldve been. Its potential was so clear, its like they tried to make it as convoluted and stupid as possible.Worst of all, the movie takes itself dead seriously. It thinks its so great, and again for the millionth time, IT COULDVE BEEN. But no, The Counselor refuses to take other people into consideration. Its so in love with itself it gives no one else a reason to love it, let alone care. Watch at your own risk.",False
"Story + Special Effects = Success!(No Spoilers!) Excitedly submitting my comments two weeks prior to the opening of the film (after a preview screening at the Ziegfeld Theater), I am thrilled to add to what appears to be a growing wave of positive reaction to Lucass effort in Episode III. As a lifelong fan deeply caught in a love hate relationship with Episodes I and II, I cautiously awaited this final installment. I felt in my heart that this would be a great film, but feared that somehow I would again be disappointed. Maybe I was starting to succumb to the notion that I no longer had the spirit of that six year old boy who was mesmerized by the original Star Wars, long ago in 1977 at that far away NJ theater. Maybe.From the opening 20th Century Fox logo, the movie hits the ground running, proving once again the CGI capabilities of ILM and the thrills they inspire. However, unlike the first two films, where spectacular effects were layered upon complicated, contrived and sometimes dramatically vacant scenes executed with some of the worst performances in memory, there is solid story telling here. And thats the difference.The drama builds steadily in the first act before hitting light speed with a combination of excitement, dread, intrigue and pain. This strong dramatic spark ignites the entire cast, helping them turn in what are easily their best performances of the three films. When you have a script with this kind of thump and talented actors, the result is fun to watch. And for once, perhaps most importantly, the special effects serve the script, not the other way around.Anakins internal struggle, present from frame one, quickly consumes him, catapulting the film towards its inevitable conclusion. While its no surprise that the film ends on a desperate note, there does remain a glimmer of possibility as the story segues into the aptly titled classic Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Its thought provoking and inspiring.Its also worth noting that as advertised the film is dark, makes no apologies, and is much less child friendly then the others. All pluses in my opinion.The final result with Revenge is a complete film that I will never forget, a somewhat renewed perspective on what Lucas was going for with Episodes I and II, and assurances that that little boy inside me is still there, popcorn in hand, ready for a good movie.",False
"Cher is great Moonstruck is a love story. There is not one romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Lorettas family.

When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy Loretta meets Johnnys brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage).

"Wonderful Waking Life is an amazing, visual, and completely original work of art from filmmaker Richard Linklater. It is not only one of the very best films to be released in 2001, but also one of the most thought provoking films Ive ever seen.  Watching it is an amazing experience in itself. 	Its visual style is stunning.  Digital animation is put over live action actors in a style that every scene is like some kind of a postmodern painting that you would see in an art gallery. 	The story follows a young man by the name of Wiley Wiggins and his encounters with many interesting people.  He listens to their thoughts and theories, but doesnt really understand why.  He is in an ongoing lucid dream that takes him to odd, but fascinating encounters with people and places. 	I absolutely loved this film.

"Art in 2015: This is why we make and watch films Right up front let me tell you this is not an easy film to watch. It is vulgar, raw, painful and shocking at times. It is, however, going to stand for some time as this generations example of how to write a story, tell a story, and create characters that are not only believable, but memorable. Tangerine, the gift we get on Christmas in America, is a story about people who live in constant chaos, in an unsafe and harsh America where not everyone gets sterling silver from the man in the North pole. It is a visually stunning achievement and reminds us that those of us who make art are first and foremost storytellers. Bravo to those who were brave enough to produce, act in and make this story come to our movie screens. Watch out Hollywood, the next generation of artists making movies has arrived.",False
"Blood Brothers What does it take to turn someone into a killer? The answer is different for each character involved in this movie. For some it is survival. For others it is the hope of escape from a life of hell. For some it is family. For others it is greed. Caught in the middle of it all are the children who have such little desire to kill for any reason that they must be brainwashed into becoming the instruments of their masters who claim to offer freedom.Every few years an action movie comes along that has amazing depth. Terminator 2 and The Matrix are such movies, and so is Blood Diamond. It is full of characterizations weve seen before, but its the interaction that raises this film above the masses. Each character has an agenda that forces him or her to distrust everyone else. The paths that some relationships take to develop trust are believable, while others are equally believable in remaining eternally antagonistic. And through it all is the realization that while some characters may change their methodology and morals, none ever change their dreams. Each character fights for the goal to the bitter end. Such is human nature, and such is the conflict of Blood Diamond, the conflict of Africa. In the end, we are left to wonder if peace can ever be attained in such a world. And somehow we are left believing that maybe it can.",True
"Every War Movie is Different.  Every War Movie is the Same.More than anyone, I would imagine that U.S. Soldiers would have a more specific opinion of this film than anyone else. They were there, they were in it, no one knows better than they.And there are two kinds of soldiers: those who loved it, who took great pride and honor in serving their country... and those who saw it as just a job, got out, and got on with their lives. Jarhead is based on a book, written by a U.S. Marine, who falls squarely into the second category.He does not judge, he does not come out as for or against the war. This is not a political movie, yet will still make some people uncomfortable, and it should. Jarhead lays out the experience of one particular Marine from boot camp, to (suddenly) Operation Desert Shield, to Operation Desert Storm. What happens here is not always pretty, but it is the truth, and the truth should be all we can ask for.The screenplay was adapted by William Broyles Jr., who in addition to some TV work, adapted the recent Planet of the Apes remake, and Cast Away. Personally, I didnt think either of these films were anything special, which is why Jarhead is such a surprise. Not a lot blows up, theres no huge siege like in your typical Vietnam movie... its a surprisingly affecting study of this one man, the experiences he had, the people he knew. Its about the Corps, and its about brotherhood. Our main character, Swof, never judges, never mentions politics, is only the best Marine that he knows how to be.As Swofs friend Troy says at one point, F*** politics. Were here. All the rest is bull****. Which is all the movie is about, really. This is what happened. Take it or leave it.",False
"Fun for the whole family.Although not regarded in the same league as the Pixar and Disney output, the initial three Ice Age instalments collected over $2bn at the worldwide box office. (Rather surprisingly, thats $100m more than the Toy Story trilogy earned.) Posting figures as huge as that means we get treated to another adventure with mammoth Manny (Ray Romano), sabretooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and silly sloth Sid (John Leguizamo); this time with pirates. Like each episode before it, Ice Age 4 prides itself in offering up goofy laughs and goofier characters, with the ragtag bunch of pirates – led by Peter Dinklages droll Captain Gutt and assisted by Nick Frosts uproarious elephant seal Flynn – the source of much joy. The old gang dont dissatisfy either: Sid is the standout as usual but Diego gets more laughs than normal and Scrats little journey is everamusing. The serious Manny is still, well, the serious Manny, but you cant win them all. The bucket load of action remains too, however nothing here tops the dinosaur rumbling in part three. Continental Drift is gratifying escapism for the whole family that, despite being the fourth outing for these prehistoric creatures, shows few signs of letting up.",False
"Payne knows exactly what hes doing, and what hes doing is tremendous.Alexander Payne hasnt made a film from the directors chair since his incredible Sideways back in 2004. Seven years later, he finally returns, and with The Descendants, he returns with a bang.Like Sideways, his screenplay (cowritten by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) nails the tone right on the head. It has to balance out three tricky narratives in the film (Matt Kings selfcrisis, his comatose wifes affair with another man before her boating accident, and a land deal hes reported to make), and without the proper guidance it needed, along with Paynes own confidant direction, it could have faltered. Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.The characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. Matt King was a perfect role for George Clooney. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface. Shailene Woodleys character (Woodley, by the way, gives one of the years best performances) begins with a rebellious, even angry sadness, but we can see her develop over the course of the film, gaining a strong maturity beyond her years. Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count.It really is an emotional ride, even depressing sometimes, but Im surprised by the occasional review I read where critics say they didnt feel the emotion to be sincere. In my opinion, the emotions of the film never hit a single false note. I dont think just anybody could have made this movie the way it is. This isnt a typical drama, the movies genre is Payne, and he knows exactly what hes doing.***1/2 out of ****",True
"Surprised This Film Doesnt Get More Credit Confessions of a Dangerous M Ind was excellent and Im surprised it doesnt receive more credit.The story is an autobiographical tale of TV producer Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) who doubles as a CI Aassassin. The movie is based on the book with the same name and the beauty is that no one knows if Barris made up this story or if the events are true. Regardless of its reality or not, the film is a tremendous example of great movie making.This is an allstar movie. George Clooney stars as CI Aagent Jim Byrd and also directs the film. He has such a cinematic eye. The scenes in which he incorporates the movie with real life clips of the game shows is brilliant. The acting is superb with Rockwell delivering what should have been at least a Golden Globe nomination. Also in the movie is Drew Barrymore (delivering one of her better roles), Julia Roberts, Rutger Hauer, and cameos by Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Maggie Gyllenthaal. The cinematography is superb, and Director of Photography, Newton Thomas Sigel, creates a film with such innovative lighting and tones, and to top it off, the screen play is written by one of Hollywoods best, Charlie Kaufmann (wrote Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine).The movie was shadowy but not dark, humorous but not too light, mysterious but not deceptive and was honestly one of the most original films Ive seen in a long time. The only minor hiccups I had with the movie was 1) inaccuracies with aging characters. Barris was born in 1928, yet the scenes in the late 1970s and early 1980s he looks like hes still in his thirties! At least the movie was consistent in not aging any of the characters; and 2) I felt the pace dragged slightly at times. There were moments when I felt the momentum falter inexplicably and the opener was slightly slow as well.But those details are very minor and do not take away from the strength of this film. This is an engaging film, one that is intelligent and wellwritten, one that is acted superbly and crafted with such subtle craftsmanship from the best Hollywood has to offer. Great film! Im surprised it doesnt get more credit8 out of 10!",False
"Effective, thought provoking, and mismarketed.Not much to say that hasnt been already the critics are right, it is an effective slick movie that may be a bit slight as far as character development but doesnt suffer too badly for it. This is a movie far more about ideas than people and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Excellent direction from Soderbergh, masterful cinematography, and while there are a few logical missteps, the writing more than makes up for that by confounding expectations more than once in truly creative and credible ways. Unfortunately trailers have many seeking an action thrillride, when what it delivers for the most part is a slow boiling suspenseful drama. When will Hollywood learn that setting expectations that dont match the product may sell a few extra tickets in the beginning, but hurts word of mouth and user reviews which are needed for the success of a film beyond the opening weekend.",True
"Painfully boring and irritating This is the worst film I have seen in 50 years of movies going. It is filmed in an irritating shaky hand held camera style that is mostly out of focus. using close up techniques that are pointless, it has long repetitious scenes of passengers in a minibus. The dialogue is slurred and unintelligible. The movie seems unscripted. There are long tedious and repetitious scenes of passengers in a minibus, who, to combat boredom, sing along to the radio. This happens about 5 or 6 times throughout the movie. It was painful to watch and I was left with a feeling of being stuck in a 3 hour traffic jam with no AC, no phone, no water and bursting to use the toilet. How anybody could rate this tiresome selfconsciously pretentious film above a 1 is a mystery.",True
"Magic on the screen: Monroe fights the New York heat and gives pleasure to EwellIn the fifties Hollywood created its biggest, bestloved and most powerful sex symbol of allMarilyn Monroe Marilyns appeal was, perhaps, in her weakness, in that revealing look of innocence and confidence, in her intense desire to be loved The seven year itch points out the instinctive desire to be disloyal after seven years of matrimony, with a longing to satisfy ones sexual needs This amusing film was adapted from a Broadway play of the same name by George Axelrod, with Tom Ewell reprising his Broadway role, walking, worrying, and sweating Tom and Evelyn Kayes have been married for seven years While he remains in Manhattan on business, Evelyn and their son Ricky (Butch Bernard) go off to Maine to escape the sweltering summer The apartment upstairs has been rented to a television blonde model (Marilyn Monroe). When she forgot her front door key, she had to ring Ewells bell to let her into the building When Marilyn accidentally knocks a tomato plant onto Toms terrace, the happily man invites the luscious young beauty downstairs for a drink, indulging in fantasies about taking her in his arms and kissing her very quickly and very hard Marilyn comes in, explaining that she feels safe with married men... He makes a clumsy pass while they are at the piano but both fall off the seat He stammers an apology, but she pretends it is nothingWhen Marilyn returns to her apartment, Tom envisions his wife having an affair in Maine with their big neighbor, Tom Mc Kenzie (Sonny Tufts) Then he sees himself lost between foolish fantasies of seduction, and terrible ideas of his wife capturing him in action Finally he decides to put an end to his visions and asks Marilyn out to a movie... On their way home, they stop on a subway As the trains go by underneath, Marilyns skirts billow up It is so hot in the city she presumably loves the rush of air on her thighs Marilyn plays the scene in innocent delight And Billy Wilders shot shows a strapping blonde with a white skirt blown out like a spinnaker above her waist For this famous shot alone, the movie is a must see",True
"A raucous buddy comedy and stuff.Im sure this film is going to divide audiences, in the same way that Kingsman did.Its 1977 Los Angeles. Star Wars has premiered. Disco is in full swing. And porn star Misty Mountains has just died (spectacularly). Its pretty disturbing then that dodgy licensed private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired two days later to find Misty by the slightly kooky Mrs Glenn (Lois Smith, the equally kooky doctor in Minority Report) who saw her through the windows of Mistys home. Never one to turn down a pay check, Holland takes the case and the trail leads him to search for a missing girl called Amelia (Margaret Qualley). This leads him right into the substantial fists of the heavy for hire Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe), whos been hired by Amelia NOT to be found. But its clear that Amelia is at the centre of a tornado of intrigue, since her mother Judith (Kim Basinger) is head of the Justice department and there are some heavies from New York and Detroit looking for Amelia too.As the films tagline admits The Nice Guys are far from nice, and this is a sort of bromance buddy movie of the likes of Lethal Weapon. (And that comparison is 100% valid since  and I honestly discovered this after I wrote that  director Shane Black (Iron Man 3) got into cinema by writing the screenplay for the original Lethal Weapon back in 1987). But The Nice Guys has an edge that those films of the 80s couldnt have got away with. Subtle it aint. There is a lot of violence, a bit of 70s porn and some fruity language that sensitive viewers may find offensive. (All in all, its a bit of a surprise that it got away with a 15 certificate in the UK).But its also insanely funny at times. Some of the sight gags are laugh out loud material (and I dont tend to act on that often in a packed cinema). You might recall in Diamonds Are Forever that a Vegas hood tosses Plenty O Toole out of Bonds hotel window. Good Shot quips Bond. I didnt know there was a pool down there responds the hoodlum. The basics of this scene are given a fresh and wonderfully gory rework that is truly memorable.Gosling and Crowe have great chemistry together (although the degree of acting required by Crowe is debatable: he looks and acts like he seems to in most media interviews!) Some of their dialogue appears distinctly adlibbed, which shows how comfortable they were with the roles. And Matt Bomer and Beau Knapp make memorably crazed villains. A role that unfortunately does irritate is Qualleys: the character of Amelia is supposed to be a bit crazed, but her speaking part is 120% off the scale.The acting star of the show though is young Australian Angourie Rice as Hollands morallycentred and bright daughter Holly, who steals just about every scene shes in. A young lady to watch for the future.1970s LA is nicely realised, with nice little subliminal dropin shots: a Jaws 2 poster; Tower Records; the original Hollywood Tower Hotel. And the film naturally attracts some banging 70s tunes to the soundtrack, with Al Green peerless over the closing titles.But its not perfect. The plot is quite impenetrable (Im still unclear exactly what the relationship between Misty and Amelia was). And Blacks screenplay (written with Anthony Bagarozzi) overeggs the pudding of the final showdown scene. But while it wont be to everyones tastes, I thought it was a blast from beginning to end: a guilty pleasure of bad taste that begs for a sequel. I would go to see the Gosling/Crowe show again. One of the most entertaining films of the year so far.Please visit http://bobthemovieman.com to see the graphical version of this review and provide feedback on your views. (Thanks).",False
"One of the best/most complex science fiction films Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in which the technology is advanced, but not farfetched. Cars can drive themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a precrime unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.We learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies, now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are trying to track him down.Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo the style of black & white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to noirs morally ambiguous charactersa good cop with an illegal habit that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things he loves.But this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion thats going through him. Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow authoritatively plays the respected father figure.This is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority Report.The Maltese Falcon ~ film noir A Clockwork Orange ~ science fiction Blade Runner ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)***** out of *****",False
"Waltz is a Genius!!!!!I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (cmon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite theatrical (couldnt think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!",True
"Great visual film that concentrates on one aspect of a brilliant but troubled rock legend.Jim Morrison wrote many of the Doors songs and was a complete drunk by the time he died in 1971. This film depicts Morrison in a very one sided view. Yes he was an alcoholic with a disregard for authority, yes he was on self destruct mode and burnt out quickly reaffirming the James Dean Live fast Die young motif. But what is missing from Stones depiction of him was his great intellect,his absurd humour and his natural talent as a composer and vocalist. However it is a wonderfully visual film that takes the viewers on a hallucinogenic ride through drug hazed Los Angeles in the late 60s. It was the first of many films that Stone created in the 90s using an almost dream like quality to evoke the feeling of the turbulent times.Although this picture is not a 100% accurate account of who or what Jim Morrison was it is still very engaging and enjoyable. A good place for someone who is new to the Doors to start.",True
"Sharing is not Caring...I watched this film without reading a single review; my 14 year old son and I watched the trailer, thought it looked cool and watched it. Now Im reading many poor reviews and wondering why?This film wont set your world on fire or win an Oscar for best actress etc, but the message is compelling. Taking a spin on how much data we give away to companies like Google, Amazon or Apple, The Circle focuses on privacy and our right to it, or lack of rights to it, in modern society.The interesting take from this is that my children and I have differing views on the value of sharing on social media; after watching the film the 14 year old was a lot more aware of the issues around making our lives so public.This film doesnt deserve an Oscar, but it does deserve better reviews than it has received. Sure, you can pick holes in some of the plot, but its message is strong. It was fantastic to watch Tom Hanks in a role not based on a true story, with a hint of menace to his character. Bill Paxtons final ever role before his sad passing is touching, and Emma Watson was interesting in her portrayal of Mae Holland.If youre looking for something different to watch, ignore the reviews and give this a go.",False
"Not to be confused with other genx films SINGLES is a charming, romantic movie and one of Cameron Crowes best. 
An oftheard criticism of this film is that its not an authentic portrayal of the Gen X culture of the early 90s, but Ive yet to see that done well in any film.More importantly, the film never claims to be a Gen X film.  Its set in Seattle during the height of Seattle Sound but the cast is made up of driven professionals and slackers alike.  Its more of a crosssection of 20somethings, not a focus on Gen X or Grunge.  The characters, settings and themes are all to a certain degree idealized, which is a staple of Crowes style.  Where this films charm really lies is in capturing the spirit of the early90s and the anticlassist sentiment embraced by teens and young professionals in opposition to the status is everything 1980s.  Its nice to remember a time when being socially and environmentally conscious was actually fashionable for a time.  Sadly we all got sucked into the dotcom thing and realized we can be just as bad as our parents.",False
"Demolition: The Blissful Beauty of Destruction Together, they would watch everything that was so carefully planned collapse, and they would smile at the beauty of destruction. Markus Zusak, The Book Thief Sometimes all you need is one piece to fall off the seemingly perfect construct youve built around yourself. Only then, youll realize whats been long buried beneath and almost forgotten. That one piece was the tragic death of Davis wife in a car accident in the revelatory opening sequence of Demolition.Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young banker who is married to Julia, his bosss daughter, and, from an outsiders point of view, seems to have his life all figured out. Davis subsequent emotional numbness and irrational behavior become a source of persistent annoyance to everyone around him, leading him to realize his own metaphorical death which is brought about by Julias tragic, yet necessary, death – it is the one piece that had to come apart so that Davis would notice the malfunction of his ostensibly ideal life, just like the leaking fridge in his kitchen. And this is when he decides to take everything in his life apart to get to the bottom of who he really is and how he really feels. On his journey of self exploration, Davis crosses paths with Karen (Naomi Watts), a customer service representative of a small vending machines company, and her rebellious 15yearold son, Chris (Judah Lewis).I dont think I ever wanted this movie to end. Ive watched it twice so far and Im still overwhelmed by the emotional genius of both screen writer Bryan Sipe and director Jean Marc Vallée (Dallas Buyers Club, Wild). Following Davis course of thinking, Ive been trying to take things apart in this movie to understand why I loved it so much and why I end up crying like babies every time, but I just cant put my hand on one thing – its simply everything. Not a single scene nor a single line in Demolition felt redundant or slightly detaching; they are all beautifully connected like notes in a musical piece, all leading up in an emotional crescendo to an inevitable coda that lingers way after the film ends. And despite the excessive use of montage, it all felt natural and poetic in a way. This is one film made with passion.Peering into the nature of human relationships is extremely difficult, not to mention trying to dismantle them. Thats why Davis fumbling through his existential ordeal changes from irrational to funny to understandable to incredibly relatable. We dont only take pleasure in watching Davis taking his life apart but we envy him for this melancholic yet euphoric realization of the truth that usually comes after destruction, and which we all yearn for in one way or another. Destroying entails thinking in retrospect, necessarily resulting in painful regret but one that is usually accompanied by blissful realization. Few are the movies that manage to go that deep into human relationships and come back with a bittersweet sense of salvation. Also, the unlikely relationship between Davis, Karen and her son Chris becomes a psychological shelter for the three emotionally misled characters where they get to nurture their empathy and readjust their inner compasses.The chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Judah Lewis is undeniable, and is highlighted by Sipes witty script and both actors topnotch performance. Gyllenhaals growing acting skills are literally getting out of control (and I mean it in a good way). I dont think anyone could have portrayed Davis as harmoniously as he did, putting you in tears while bringing a smile to your face. After Enemy, Nightcrawler, and Southpaw, Gyllenhaal is slowly and steadily becoming one of the smartest and most talented actors today.One more thing that makes this experience unforgettable is the music. Ive mentioned before that this is a film made with passion, and nothing can give voice to passion as much as music does. I will not talk about the brilliant choices of songs and the perfect songscene synchronization because that will only make sense when you watch the film.Demolition will leave you miserably heavyhearted but spiritually elevated beyond words.I give it 10 out of 10",True
"Great acting, simple story This movie should be reviewed for its great performances from some of the best actors today. Meryl Streep does not fail to shine out as one of the best actresses of all time as an emotionally distraught mother in this tale of hopes, emotions and intense feelings. Keaton, on the other hand portrays her best performance ever, and Leonardo Di Caprio proves that he has talents besides being a heartthrob. This movie really moved me, not because of the story itself but the acting was very realistic....I believe that they all should have received an Oscar nomination. Well done!",False
"Thoroughly unpleasant...like a twohour plus root canal without the Novocaine.This is one of those special movies that manages to be good but unwatchable at the same time. In other words, while the script may be an accurate of the most unpleasant couple in history as they spend an evening entertaining some annoying guests, some (like me) might wonder why anyone would want to see this! For example, they could film a brilliantly executed heart transplant or the removal of giant parasitical worms from someone, but why watch it? To me, the film was just too painful to endure.Liz Taylor and Richard Burton play a couple of drunks who are married and spend all their time destroying each other. Now, according to the film its because of the death of their son but they would have been terrible people regardlessthey truly despise each other and themselves. Then, as if an afterthought, some guests arrive and actually stay and watch as this couple destroy each other right in front of them. And so, the newcomers get drunk and the drunks get drunker. Wow...now THATS fun! Then, tongues loosen some more and a lot of unpleasantness results.Sure, having worked with alcoholics I understand that Taylor and Burton did an excellent job here. But for a twohour plus film its an endurance contest I dont wish to do again. So the overall verdict is that its well made but thoroughly awful. If you can endure and appreciate this, fine. But if you cant, dont feel like you must. Just because its rated so highly on IM Db does not mean its a mustseeespecially because this film may well leave you feeling depressed and in need of a drink!",True
"Truly superlative really happened movie I am amazed this film does not have a higher mark than 7.5 at the moment. It is difficult to see how this could have been done any better  a genuinely thrilling story that encompasses the very best in humanity.The casting is perfect  everyone puts there heart into it (Ed Harris is especially worth a mention), and the special effects are not only an incredible achievement in themselves, but also used just the way they should be  to tell the story, not replace it. The Zero G is brilliantly executed, and the CGI Saturn5 on the launch pad is utterly convincing.Regardless of the fact that we all know the outcome to the story before we start viewing, this is compelling edge of the seat stuff. Howard manages to convey the desperation of the situation, while never once leaving us without hope.This film is just sheer class from beginning to end. You will love it even if you think you arent interested in space exploration.",True
"Pretty good movie with Streep, Irons, Banderas, Close, Ryder.I only began to watch this movie because it was on Encore network, and I usually like movies with Streep and/or Irons. It kept me interested the whole 2 hours.The movie covers 3 generations and about 60 years. It is set in South America. The father (Irons) achieves his wealth, social, and political status through hard work. He is a difficult man, and when his young daughter (Winona Ryder) befriends a young peasant boy, she is sent to school away. The mother (Streep) seems to have some connection with the supernatural.Eventually a progressive party wins the election, and the old conservative party gets the military to oust the new government. Civil war almost breaks out, people are mistreated, and old relationships must be reexamined.
A good study in character and family relationships, moves a bit slow at times, but represents leisure storytelling. A good movie, I give it 7 of 10. I believe it was loosely based on some historical events.",False
"this is a cult movie Too bad movies like this dont get a bigger budget, specially to enhance the special effects and futuristic scenarios, but that really doesnt matter when you are a creative genius like Gilliam, he does a great job with what he is given. This movie has great resemblance to his other retro futuristic movie Brazil, which combines retro and futuristic images and elements in a Dystopian chaotic Orwellian future.Here we struggle with the main character (wonderful played by Christoph Waltz) and his meaningless solitary existence hoping to get an answer by a higher power of what life is all about.So can the hero find out the meaning of life or the absence of it? and will he be willing to sacrifice his potential joy and happiness in order to get that mysterious call. Well you will be the judge.If you like this movie I also recommend PI by Aronofsky, Brazil, Blade runner, 1984, THX1138 among other great ones. Hopefully this movie will become a cult classic and show new directors that they dont require 100+ million dollars to make good scifi movies. Thanks and cheers to Gilliam for sticking for what he believes in and daring to tackle difficult philosophical questions and having that original fingerprint he stamps in all his great movies.",True
"For me it isnt the greatest ever, but its still great Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New Yorkarea mafia family in the 1940s, in this wellrespected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving business guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connies (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his familyincluding Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. Even though Ive given it a 10, I wouldnt put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. Ive given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely mustsee viewingeven if its only because its so highly regardedif youve not experienced the film yet. I think its a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soapoperatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also cowrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of charactersmaybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after youve watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again? The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soapoperatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through lifeincluding marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the films appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfathers brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichis violence is effective, setting that knob to 11 doesnt make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of oscillating dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. Its tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rotas score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless youre looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) zoom out from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully litmost of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that its a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldnt believe its something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you havent seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the greatest film of all time hype. Thats only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely youll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywoods more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that its as much a historical family saga as a crime or gangster film.",True
"Complex subject lightened up for the screen.Have you ever witness a hysterical person having a crisis? I havent, probably neither have you. Could that be the reason why to some reviewers (including myself) the histrionics of Keira Knightley as a hysterical patient were embarrassing to watch on the screen? I don know. Probably real hysteria looks like that but in daily life a witness wont feel what a film viewer feels when being forced to watch incessantly all those facial and body contortions on close ups.After those first oversized and overdramatic scenes, the film takes a very natural tempo either on camera work or in tone down dialogs, serene outdoor and indoor scenes, making a very well mannered, ultra civilized and fascinating film indeed.The professionalism of everyone involved in it is impeccable and the script sound as it could be for a one and a half hour film explaining to a general public something as complicated as psychoanalysis involving two of the most important personalities of the last century responsible to have revolutionized and changed the course of history in that field for ever after.Some reviewers criticized this movie as elemental, as too basic while I think it wasnt meant for a professional audience of top psychologists, but merely a very good piece of entertainment for the masses and at the same time with modest doses of knowledge about a theme that in general is unknown to the great majority and vastly complicated.Same goes for the criticism of some reviewers about the sex life of these people when it came to show them in bed doing their own Kamasutra. How far did they expected the sex scenes to go? to the point of impregnation of the female and posterior birth as its consequence?I dont know, I think that that was beside the point in this very serious movie and moreover, that kind of titillation should be look for on a different kind of movie. To me this was an excellent movie very fulfilling from all points of view.",False
"Thank you IM Db Knowing this movie was nominated for best picture, I was afraid that I was losing my mind after seeing it, since what I saw in the theater was: one dimensional characters being frustrated about not being able to do anything, intercut with a newsreel about current events, followed a ridiculously overdone operation to kill a couple people in a house.No doubt this is a difficult story to tell dramatically, since its about people who are doing a job that is passive by nature. But what was striking is how completely devoid it was of character. Courtroom dramas trade in the same stock, but even the most pedestrian episode of Boston Legal or LA Law contain more compelling characters than anyone in this movie.And most movies about real events overcome the inherent story problems by provoking thought in the audience about the events themselves. What they lack in dramatic momentum, they make up for in unsettling questions. But it was amazing how completely empty this film was of anything resembling a question about what was going on. It was as if Kathryn Bigelow thought she was just presenting reality to the audience. In 50 years, people are going to look back at this movie in the same way that we look at the jingoistic WWII Hollywood features now  as empty fare designed to prop up our fragile national psyche. Maybe thats what people need right now. But lets not pretend its a quality film.",False
"A story to take with you Compelling with beautiful shots and music. Watched on Netflix where other options and distractions are a abundant, but I did not put this down. It is quite the untold story about such a huge political and inhumane problem within Africa today. Casting was great, very memorable faces. I would say this is what American Sniper should have been like. The changes in characters was gradual and smooth, PTSD and other issues were presented much better. Eye opening in a way old stories used to be. This was much more than entertainment, but more of a virtual experience like Saving Private Ryan was. Quite gritty as well, which doesnt bother me, but for those that are sensitive this will be a hard watch.",False
"Extremely funny film about grief, anger, revenge and violence It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from Fargo would forever be the most memorable character of Frances Mc Dormands acting career. But now Im not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from Three Billboards, is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with Mc Dormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.Apart from Mc Dormands performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are onedimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coenesque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesnt know the difference between polo and polio.It is hard to mention something negative about this film. Three Billboards is, from start to finish, a great movie. I cant imagine anyone not enjoying it.",False
"The Swan Song of Iranian cinema?Asghar Farhadis new film after the ingenious About Elly is running for the Golden Bear at this years Berlin Film Festival and, with half of the competition done and the rest of the program not looking too promising, appears to be an almost inevitable winner. Although maybe it wont for that very reason: Jahar Panahis repeat inability to attend his jury duties because of Irans government refusal to issue him a travel permit, a retrospective of his works including the 2006 Silver Bearwinning Offside, a variety of other Iranian productions and renewed demonstrations in Iran proper put the spotlight firmly on that countrys elaborate, yet constrained film industry. All that buzz may outshine the films artistic value, and prompt the jury to go for a less favored competitor. I should hope not, for Farhadi manages once again to embed lots of social criticism into a straightlaced, realistic narrative.As in About Elly, the story begins rather unassumingly and takes an abrupt turn into a spiral of increasingly dramatic events: Nader and Simin are a couple about to break up over the question of moving abroad, for which they have obtained a permit after waiting for 18 months. Nader, however, has his father to take care of, who is suffering from Alzheimers. Sirin still wants to leave, but not without her daughter (yes, pun intended) Termeh, a somewhat shy, bespectacled 11yearold who cannot accept her parents breakup. She therefore decides to stay with her father, which prompts Simin not to leave the country, but move to her mother. Nader is thereby forced to hire someone to take care of his dad, and a colleague of Sirin recommends the pregnant Razieh. Being deeply religious, she should not work in a single mans household, but her husband has been out of a job for a long time and is threatened with jail by his creditors. Her pregnancy and the necessity to attend to her daughter additionally stress her out. When Nader comes home one day to find his father left alone and tied to his bed, a struggle with the returning Razieh ensues, with catastrophic consequences for everyone around...This is a much more complicated setup than in About Elly, but it allows Farhadi to put a lot of additional information into his film as may be obvious to those who are just trying to follow the story (I hesitate to give examples because the film is as of yet to be released in Iran, which means an opensource comment such as this one needs to be carefully phrased). Much of the action takes place in courtrooms, where judges try to negotiate between the parties without any lawyers present. Theres a lot of familiarity, and also a lot of menace, which succeeds to create the same climate of anxiety, accusation and deceit as in About Elly. The realism of the narrative is embedded into a carefully planned scenography which makes almost every shot linger in the memory. And as in About Elly the decisive moment, the one that solves the mystery is omitted in the picture, only to be explained verbally at the very end.What makes me feel even more for this film is the fact that it might be the last film of its kind from Iran for some time. Ali Samadi Ahadi, the German Iranian director of the comedy Salami Aleikum and the upcoming documentary on the July 2009 protests The Green Wave, wrote that the film industry has come to a virtual standstill. Nader and Simin was in development at the time of the protests; since then, regulations have become far more repressive, with even established masters like Kiarostami or Makhmalbaf forced to work abroad, and others threatened with jail and work prohibitions, of whom Panahi is only the most famous example. All the more reason to give this film the credit it deserves  winning Berlin may cause Irans bureaucrats to reconsider, for cinema is almost the last link remaining to our world. Without film, how could we understand that Iranians are a modern people with issues like our own, and not dangerous fanatics as some media and politicians would have us believe?",False
"Far From Earth Far From Heaven has been explained as a womans film, and a surefire tear jerker, but in fact its intended for the kind of woman who would cry at the sight of a washing machine that wobbles a bit during its spin cycle.
Todd Haynes has lovingly perfected the surface of this film with the skill of a master mortician.  However, beneath its perfect surface, its equally dead.  All of Haynes energy has gone towards recreating the details and trappings of a past era of (lets face it) relatively minor film making, and theres no energy left to imbue the characters with power, believability or any trace of interior life.  Therefore, Kathleen can utter ridiculous lines some ice please after shes just been belted by her husband and, without losing her pastedon smile for a second, can make chirpy little jokes about her husbands disgustingly ugly drunken behavior at the party that she has spent most of the film (and perhaps most of her life) planning.  As game as Moores acting is, her character is like a windup doll.
Quaids part is even worse.  Although I like him as an actor, he has no clue how to portray the inner conflict of a gay man trapped in a suburban marriage, trapped in the 1950s.  For someone who feels despicable, he somehow has no difficulty ogling a cute blond kid in full public view  in front of both his own wife and the kids parents.  And though hes already been caught by both the police and his wife in flagrante delicto, he has no problem getting it on with the blond boy in his hotel room while his wife reads Cosmo by the poolside (we dont see this happen, but its clearly implied).  This is simply ridiculous.Dennis Haysberts character is forced (by the script) into similarly disingenuous behavior.  Were expected to believe that hes a Miro scholar/botanist/MBA and man about about town, yet he somehow thinks he could bring a whiterthanwhite upper class woman into a negro blues bar and the patrons would be really friendly?  And hes surprised when his fellow Blacks shower him with the same onedimensional hatred that all of Kathleens friends shower upon her?Haynes seems to view the 50s as if they occurred 1000 years ago; the characters seem not so much as from a different time as from a different species.  The result: a potential story of tremendous personal conflict and suffering ends up a curiously uninvolving pastiche, although one in Amazing Living Technicolor.  This is perhaps the only film ever made in which the leaves are more alive than the characters.",False
"Maybe Cant Really Be Appreciated Anymore If you have only seen this movie on TV, you have not really seen this movie. One of the best movie experiences of my life was seeing this movie in the theater with a full house of college students.  I have never heard an audience laugh so hard, and I was laughing with them.  That experience can never be recaptured.  I dont know why this movie doesnt make the midnight movie tour in college towns.  That way it might have some of the same impact.  Also when it came out in 1978 it is hard to explain how big John Belushi was unless you were there and saw it first hand.  Its still funny on the small screen, but only if you see it uncut.  Never watch it on a network, they cut out most of the jokes!",False
"The Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn Show Dead Man Walking deals with one nuns struggle (Susan Sarandon in her Oscarwinning part) to help a convicted death row inmate (Sean Penn in an Oscarnominated role) come to terms with his imminent execution. Writerdirector Tim Robbins does something very difficult in this film, he makes us care about the unsympathetic character that Penn plays.  Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn dominate the film in every aspect imaginable, they play a complicated chess match at times and eventually become close friends by the end of the picture.  The fact that Sarandon and Robbins are openly against the death penalty in real life just adds to this film.  Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",True
"Brilliant, especially Di Caprio On Leonardo Di Caprios 31st birthday, I have the pleasure of praising one of the finest actors working today. I didnt realize what I was seeing when that homeless boy showed up on Growing Painsa show not exactly known for the quality of its actors. And I didnt see much to like about Titanic except the excitement of watching the people evacuating and the ship sinking. Also, Romeo and Juliet was just corny, with 400yearold dialogue in a modern setting.But if he could be nominated for his Aviator performance, Di Caprio must be doing something right. And here he shows us what he is capable of. Especially when Frank Jr. is conning people, and most of all when he tries to outwit Hanatty. I am reminded of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive, or perhaps Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in Smokey and the Bandit. The strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes a long way toward making this movie work.Frank Jr. showed a lot of intelligence, and Di Caprio effectively showed us what this man could do. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed on the right side of the law. But his life on the run was more fun to watch.Tom Hanks, as popular as he is, can be commended for his willingness to play second banana for a change. And he did a fine job. Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken also made an impact here.I loved the old cars and the even older songs. The clip from To Tell the Truth was a nice touch. The theme song still gives me a craving for vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years (I didnt feel I had time to watch the new version).This was Oscarcaliber. Too bad the Academy Awards people didnt seem to agree.",True
"Engrossing and heartbreaking glimpse into an unfortunate life James White (Christopher Abbott) is caught in an endless cycle of selfdestruction. He has just lost his father and fears losing his ailing mother (Cynthia Nixon) who he has been taking care of for years. He spends his days drinking, sleeping around and lashing out at others, doing anything to avoid confronting his grief and emotions, which he keeps under the surface, bubbling and waiting to burst. Life has been unfair to him, and this behaviour that manifested sabotages any chance of career or personal growth. He might be using his mothers condition as an excuse not to step out of his comfort zone and try harder in life, which is reasonable to some extent, but he cant seem to change. In his prime, he is jobless and taking his mothers couch as a bed.This narratively loose drama doesnt offer anything particularly new in giving us a glimpse into the struggles, both internal and external, faced by James. There is not much closure or emotional reward to be given. This is summed up perfectly in one of the very few scenes in which we see James surrendering to his emotions, crying while repeatedly yelling I dont know what to do.The best aspect of the film is the acting. Nixon gives an authentic, heartbreaking performance thats understated. Abbott, on the other hand, is given a character that requires patience and sensitivity to sympathize with. James internalizes many complex emotions throughout the film and what goes on in his mind is not always clear to the audience. Its a tricky act to balance but Abbott pulls it off. Their motherson relationship is the only thing thats certain in their lives and is the core of the film.The film could have very well ended during its most powerful and stirring scene with James and his mother in the toilet. She cant get up, so they sit and talk about what their ideal life would be like and the future they had hope for. They feel at peace as both of them stay in this moment, still and smiling. This is when the bleak reality of the film truly sets in, as we see these people, both kind and full of dreams and desires, trapped in an unfortunate life.",False

"Amazing Performance An eye opener for me. James Brown was one of the great innovators and leaders in American music and yet for many people he is a total unknown. Watching the movie one finds that his influence was immense on many of the musicians that followed him in all the many forms American music has evolved over the time, from rhythm and blues to rock and roll. It is fascinating look at the times from the post World War 2 period through the turmoil of the Civil Rights era. It is also a revelation about the music and the man. Amazing performance by Chadwick Boseman. The contrast between his portrayal of Jackie Robinson in 42 and this shows a great strength in acting ability. It is a truly Oscar worthy performance in and of itself. Hats off to Mick Jagger for producing this movie.",False

Charles Bronson is such a surprise as the father.",False
"Vastly underappreciated film This movie is not a movie that makes you think. Its not arty, there are no Corleones, theres really no issues to ponder long after the credits have stopped rolling. Instead its a human drama that uses a courtroom battle as its backbone, but the entire body is the honestlytold if ultimately remarkable of a greenhorn lawyer trying to make a life for himself after law school. Like the more recent Garden State the movie is far more interesting than one would initially expect.I recently read the Grisham novel that the screenplay was adapted from and was impressed by the memorable cast of the characters. The corruptandlovingit Prince and Bruiser, Deck Shiflett as the skeezy paralawyer who scrapes out a living with an amusing lack of selfconsciousness, the bittertempered first judge and his pioneering, biased black successor, the politely patronizing and puffedup Legal Titan Leo Drummond, Cliff and his straightfrom Deliverance hillbilly family, lonely and slightly bossy Miss Birdie, chainsmoking Dot and her addled husband, all of them set a standard for memorable but believable characters.Yet the movie is itself a cut or two above the original material. The extended cast does a handsdown fantastic job of bringing each character to life. First billing has to go to Danny Devito for transforming Deck from Rudys unscrupulous and ugly sidekick in the novel, into a more takecharge and casually hilarious partner. Just take a look at the scene where he leads Rudy into the hospital or when hes giving out his card to the kids in Dots neighborhood. But thats just one of about twenty stellar acting jobs. The extended cast includes Danny Glover, Jon Voight, Claire Danes, Mickey Rourke (yes!), Virginia Madsen, and a handful of other talented but lesserknown actors who show their absolute best through the skillful lens of Coppola.Besides the stellar job by the cast, the story is tweaked to absolute perfection. Whether its the Coppola magic or an excellent adaptation and editing job, I see a transformation similar to his triumph with The Godfather: an absorbing but complex and sometimes rambling story is condensed into its absolute essence. Not a single shot is out of place.Something else struck me about this adaptation  it reminds me of Peter Jacksons LOTR in the way comic moments are used to balance out the weightiness of the main plot. For example: in LOTR Merry and Pippin set off Gandalfs dragon fireworks, or in the second movie Gimli cant see over the parapet towards the advancing Urukhai, or in the third movie Sam and Gollum have their argument over the proper preparation of rabbits and taters and Gandalf instructs Pippin to keep his big mouth shut before they enter the hall of Minas Tirith. Likewise The Rainmaker has its little touches of humor as well, from the sardonic lawyer jokes in Rudys voiceover, to the scene where Deck fakehelpfully hands over Drummonds lost shoe after hes been assaulted by an angry juror, to Rudys redfaced apology to the car accident victim in traction whom he has accidentally jostled, to Madsens laconic yet particularly devoted husband Bert. (Guess who DIED last night? ...Do you ever sleep?) There is anxiety during Kellys return to her house, the suspense of the bug showdown, the pathos of Rudys final speech: all these combine with the lighter moments to balance each other like a film version of Pickapeppa sauce.Who could have ever guessed that a Grisham novel could be so perfectly adapted to the screen?! Just try watching the Pelican Brief afterward for comparison. My hat is off to Coppola, his cast, and everyone else who contributed to this understated masterwork.",False
"Wonderful movie, a must see 3DI saw the trailer and I enjoyed it but I was afraid that all the good parts from the movie will be there and that will be all, like it was with many films lately. That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.I didnt read the book, so I dont know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldnt hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with  the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real. I agree its not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once its finished bot its not meant to be. Its just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and Im 22). The film wasnt too long, it didnt have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.I dont know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again. Great special effects and, again, a very lovely dragon.",False
"Thered better be some Oscar nominations coming for this little gem.SPOILER: But I cant forever carry them kids and my mom, not without that house.Winters Bone is a stark, almost documentarylike movie about a poor teenage girl named Ree in the Ozarks who supports her nearcatatonic mother and two younger siblings during her methcooking fathers many brushes with the law. When he disappears before a court date and the familys home is at risk if he doesnt show up, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) investigates amongst the locals to find out where he might be. But, some people dont like the questions shes asking, and her life may be at risk, along with her family home. The plain, unobtrusive way that the camera observes events really helped draw me into the movie, to the point where I honestly forgot that I was watching a movie, at all. This effect was heightened by some excellent performances; especially from Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes (Teardrop). Lawrence had a starmaking (and award worthy) performance, in my opinion. Ree is probably my favorite movie character of the year (well, perhaps next to Hit Girl), and Lawrence plays her with a realism and stubborn toughness that makes you believe that this seventeen yearold girl wouldnt wilt under the kind of circumstances that would overwhelm most adults. Her love for her family seems completely genuine, and theres never a word or a glance where she seems like shes acting.  Its all very natural, and I was beyond impressed.The plot was quite tense and engrossing, as Ree pursues the mystery of where her father is with a dogged intensity, despite the fact that it leads her into some very dangerous (and violent) situations. The sparse, beautiful winter settings are a perfect backdrop for the story. Its been a while since Ive seen a movie that does as good a job as this one in communicating a sense of place.Winters Bone may not be for everyone, though. There are no shootouts or florid romantic scenes. The moments of happiness are small, fleeting, and poignant; like a gift of generosity from a neighbor who knows youre in need, or the quiet assurances of an older sister to her younger siblings. In Winters Bone, our world is never in danger...but one familys certainly is. I liked the movie the first time around, enjoyed it even more the second, and heartily recommend it if youre interested.",False
"Beautifully filmed Comingof Age tale on the Mississippi River Mud was very wellreceived by a packed house at the Paramount Theatre for its Regional Premiere at Austins SXSW Film Festival. The crowd particularly loved local favorites director Jeff Nichols and the always shapeshifting Matthew Mc Conaughey. (How is it possible that Mc Conaughey hasnt even been nominated for an Oscar yet?) Mud is a charming, entrancing film that has almost lyrical quality as it unfolds along the rural backwoods of Arkansass Mississippi River. The story revolves around the adventures of two young teenage boys who meet a mysterious drifter appropriately named Mud. Mud is hiding out an island in the Mississippi River awaiting the arrival of his beloved Juniper. The story has elements of drama, thriller, and romance. While the film is slightly too long and the story has a few unnecessary and distracting subplots, its overall eloquence and is absorbing. So like the Mississippi, the story meanders a little too much. The River setting becomes a character in the film that shapes the drama playing out along it. The two teenage actors are excellent, but the film is tourdeforce for Mc Conaughey who is its heart and soul. Highly recommended for those who like serious drama and appreciate natural beauty.",False
"A Completely Winning Comedy THE FIRST WIVES CLUB is a sparkling allstar comedy that hits all the right notes and makes you want to cheer out loud while youre watching. This is the story of three former college girlfriends (Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler) who are reunited after many years due to the suicide of a mutual friend (Stockard Channing) and all learn that they have been dumped by their husbands for younger women. They bond and not only plan revenge on their husbands but take their revenge to another unexpected level that is curiously refreshing for a comedy of this type. Keaton, Hawn, and Midler are marvelous as the women out for their exhusbandsblood. Stephen Collins, Victor Garber, and Dan Hedaya are all on the mark as the scummy exhusbands. There are funny bits contributed along the way by Rob Reiner as Hawns plastic surgeon, Sarah Jessica Parker as Hedayas mistress, Maggie Smith as a wealthy divorcée, Bronson Pinchot as a faux designer, Eileen Heckart as Keatons mother, and Marcia Gay Harden as Collinstherapist/mistress. A wonderful script is smartly mounted by director Hugh Wilson with an energetic cast to produce a terrific film comedy which can easily be watched several times and discover new pleasures on each viewing.",False
"A film Shakespeare could have written If the saga of Omar were a wine, it would have to be described as Shakespearian, with notes of Dante, Orwell, Golding, and Sartre. Omar is a basically decent, seemingly uncomplicated young bakery worker who is inexorably drawn into the violent political warfare of the West Bank through his love for a girl, his increasingly radicalized circle of friends from childhood, and Israeli injustice. Right up to its unexpected, yet expectable, ending Omar is more victim than protagonist.Clearly anti Israeli in tone, the film explores the many reasons why Palestinians maintain an abiding antagonism toward Israel and Israelis. A driving metaphor in the film is the 25 foot high wall that Omar scales regularly to visit Nadia, his intended. Although The Wall was ostensibly designed to separate the Jewish West Bank settlements from Palestinians, it even more effectively separates Palestinian towns, families, and friends from one anotherand from their water supplies in many places. To visit a neighboring town along is course has often become virtually impossible for having to detour long distances around the walls tortuous path and passing through multiple checkpoints. Similarly, the Israeli military and police strive to divide and isolate individuals and groups psychologically just as the wall does physically. Its a classic use of divideandconquer strategy, which is one of the films principal plot threads. Whatever your views of the Israel Palestine situation, this thoroughly absorbing film will challenge them.",False
"Its not a GUYS film only Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When youre a preteen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, theres that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.Stand by Me is about 4 preteen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. Theyve obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kids body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, its a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, its the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.These are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and cant get any love or respect from his father and its obvious that he gets it from his friends. Thats what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordys best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, hes the kid who you knew in school and just knew hed turn out bad, but theres a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child whos been disappointed so many times by an adult.Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then theres Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the others appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.The acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get preteen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the preteen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. Thats what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.10/10",True
"Strike One for Kelly Reichardt Itll all go fast in the end. Once the marine biodiversity goes, everything goes with it.I was unfamiliar with Kelly Reichardt until Night Moves, but I had heard several great things from her direction in Meeks Cutoff and Wendy and Lucy. Night Moves has also received many praises from critics so I really dont know how I will feel about her other films because this one was a disappointment for me. Perhaps I dont get her style of filmmaking but the entire film felt tedious and there wasnt any tension. For a movie that is centered on a character driven plot I really didnt feel like I learned much about these three radical environmentalists. What motivates them to take these extreme measures? All we know is that they are environmentalists, but I didnt feel like they had any distinct trait. The pacing of this film was really slow and at times I felt like abandoning it, but I continued to watch in hopes that the plot got better. After all, Hollywood Report compared it to the the suspenseful Hitchcock films of the 50s. The final third act of the film was the worst considering some of the decisions made felt completely out of character. Night Moves lacked soul and purpose, I really never managed to get into it despite how much I liked the cast. It was a numbing experience for me and no matter how gorgeous the Oregon landscape was, I simply never bought into the story. Reichardt loves to use steady shots and let the action unfold in front of us, but they were as tedious as the the slow pacing of the film. Nature might be captured beautifully in Night Moves, but the characters motivations were really hard to believe at times. I tend to enjoy low key films, but for a character driven one I really didnt see much development going on. Yes, Eisenbergs character is alienated, Fannings is strong willed, and Sarsgaards is the most adventurous, but other than that we dont get much from their restrained performances. I might be on the minority here so I will give Reichardt another chance and check out one of her previous films to see if I enjoy it better than Night Moves. I wouldnt have a problem with a slow burner like Night Moves if the final result was a rewarding experience, but the third act is even less engaging than the previous ones. I cant simply enjoy a film because its restrained and its nice to look at. Sure some of the steady long shots looked cool, but after a while it too becomes tedious as the characters in this film. Eisenberg received a lot of praise for his performance here, although I really never bought into his characters motivations. The strongest performance for me came from Peter Sarsgaard who was much more believable and understandable. Dakota Fanning had some interesting scenes as well, but I still had a hard time getting engaged with their characters. Comparisons with The East were almost inevitable for me considering the theme of this film, but somehow I didnt enjoy this as much as Batmanglijs film. That film despite having several flaws managed to maintain the tension throughout most of its running time unlike what I felt with Night Moves which simply failed to deliver suspense or any real drama.",False
"An inconvenient truth One of the most common criticisms of Thirteen is that it is unrealistic. However, Thirteen never claims to portray all thirteen year olds, hell, it doesnt even claim to portray a significant number of them. This film is about the select few who choose to take a certain path in life. They have no true parental figures, their lives are in shambles, and they are making a quick and painful transition into supposed adulthood. Notice the other people in the school scenes, theyre normal, theyre just studying, hanging out with their friends, and going through the motions of school life. Those arent the people that are being portrayed here.Nikki Reed, an immense young talent, plays Evie Zamora, the hottest and arguably most popular girl in school. Evan Rachel Wood plays Tracy, a girl who still keeps her stuffed animals and Barbie dolls on her bed, and whose parents have divorced recently and whose mother works as a hairdresser out of her home to support the family. Tracy goes to junior high completely oblivious of any of the social pressure thats present, and begins to idolize Evie, obviously a terrible role model. In an outstanding early scene, Tracy follows Evie into a shopping mall and is initially appalled at the idea of shoplifting, but in a desperate attempt to fit in with the cool crowd, she steals a purse from a woman who sat next to her, and finds Evie again, at which point she is accepted. Sooner rather than later, Tracy is drawn into a terrible depression which she deals with by using drugs, cutting herself, and being sexually promiscuous. She does all this completely uncertain of whether she wants to, and mostly because shes following Evies lead. To say that no 13 year olds have experiences similar to this is pure ignorance, and if youre a parent who thinks this is unrealistic think again, and think hard. In todays world, narcotics are available as easily as candy bars, and pop stars are more like porn stars, putting pressure on todays teens to become promiscuous sooner in life.Wood is a terrific, terrific actress who has made some questionable career choices before and since this, but I hope to see her continue to star in films like The Upside of Anger and Down in the Valley. However, in this particular film, even her tremendously powerful performance pales in comparison with Holly Hunters Oscarnominated supporting role as Tracys mother, and by Nikki Reed, who, in her first ever acting role, is nothing short of stunning. This role is very, very racy for any 15 year old to take on, and Reed, who also cowrote this films terrific script with Catherine Hardwicke, takes it on with maturity Ive never seen before from an actress of her age. First time director Catherine Hardwicke does a great job here, her work is inventive and adds real grit to this tale.The bottom line is, Thirteen is a great, realistic, disturbing urban drama that you should watch with an open mind and with knowledge that it is based in fact. This is a challenging and brave film, and everyone involved has gained immediate respect from me. One of the best of 2003.8/10",True
"Makes You Think Courage Under Fire (1996) This is a war film about an Army officer, plagued about a deadly mistake he made, who investigates a female soldiers worthiness for the Medal of Honor. It stars Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan. The film received mostly positive reviews and earned a generally favorable response. The investigation turns up some disparities that requires our lead character to not only question the female soldiers worthiness, but also his own. It examines the truth the public gets vs. the actual truth. This is a quality film that allows its audience, not only to figure out what really took place, but also whether or not it should come out at all.",False
"Scifi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.Im nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight, he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, its either allvisualsnosmarts (G.I. Joe, Transformers) or the exact opposite (Doubt, Invictus). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. Its like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity, and this is where Inception shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. Thats right, years.Once the film ends, youll want to watch it again, for theres something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (Avatar be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo Di Caprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island. He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago (The Dark Knight). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, thats really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the films point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)",True
"Great Action, Boring Romance Ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the Galactic Republic is facing a Separatist movement and the former queen and now Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) travels to Coruscant to vote on a project to create an army to help the Jedi to protect the Republic. On the arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mc Gregor) and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned to protect her. They chase the shapeshifter Zam Wessell (Leeanna Walsman) but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing the identity of who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi Wan Kenobi to discover the bounty hunter that has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Karmino and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other and he has nightmares with his mother. They travel to his planet Tattoine to see his mother and he discovers that she has been abducted by the evil Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying and he kills all the Tusken tribe including the women. Obi Wan follows Jango Fett to the planet Geonosis where he finds who is behind the Separatist movement. He transmit his discoveries to Anakin since he cannot reach the Jedi Council. Who is the leader of the Separatist movement? Will Anakin receive Obi Wans message? And the secret love between Anakin and Amidala will succeed?Star Wars: Episode II  Attack of the Clones is the second chapter of the saga with great action, but also a boring romance. The action scenes are breathless, with many battles. The romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala is annoying in many parts and weird since Amidala was a queen when Anakin was a nine yearold boy. Christopher Lee, the favorite villain of many films, is perfect as usual.

"Not among Allens greats, but still a lot of fun While not great Woody Allen – its neither profound, moving nor funny enough for that title, it is quite enjoyable. The film is made up of four intercut short stories, that share little other than the fact theyre set in Rome. Some have fantasy elements, some are more absurdist, others more straightforward character farce.But somehow, though they dont make much of a logical grouping, the whole thing is lighthearted and fun enough that it seems grumpy to pick on it. Sure some jokes fall flat and some ideas seem unfulfilled, but a lot of it is wonderfully acted and cleverly written. And at a time when so many comedies are aimed only at 15 year olds, even 2nd tier Woody, simply telling playfully comic tales, is a welcome sight.",True
"A dismal attempt at humor that lacked any substance and barely raised a chuckle from a full cinema.The Wish I Was Here storyline did have potential to be an interesting situational comedy but thats as far as it went. This film never made it to first base. The supposedly funny and overly contrived moments were consistently met with total silence from our nearly full cinema. There were a few laughs here and there but these only touched the spot for a handful in the crowd. Im sure most were Wishing I Was NOT Here and weighing up when would be an appropriate place to make an early exit and get on with their lives! The film was hamstrung with poor overacting and a script that more or less demanded just that. Ironic because the lead character is an outofwork actor struggling to impress in auditions. If you enjoy totally contrived and unrealistic scenarios, characters venting extreme, unwarranted reactions to loved ones around them, laced with crudity and heavily peppered with obscene language thats also out of place, then this is the movie for you! Youll also be treated to very skewed depictions of Jewish schooling, home schooling, and parentchild relationships.I wont tell you how the movie develops from there and I cant tell you how it ends but Im confident the main reason I was there was to pen this review to encourage you to do yourself a favor and give this film the FLICK!",False
"My 357th Review: Finally a good honest film about the downturn Whether we like it or not the last couple of years have been incredibly tough, and TCM though not perfect at least tries to make an honest film about downsizing in corporate America.We really really got this  we all know someone whose lost their home, their job, or just found that the money isnt there the way it was  and those who reviewed this and said the films doesnt work as the characters have still got it good just dont get the college payments, the mortgage, the fear of losing it all, and the horrendous amount of money it takes to maintain a life in the US now is astronomical  and TCM at least looks at this as no other film has in the past three years.Solid performances from everyone and Affleck in particular echoing his roles in Man about Town or Jersey Girl does a solid job here as the man who has it all and then has nothing. It it does try to record something which otherwise seems to be in danger of being swept under the carpet  this is a wellmade film that rings true and for our money was actually one of the more memorable and yes, even moving, films of the year  it is accessible and a likable film.",True
"The Blood Stays on the Knife Gangs of New York takes us back to a time when America was a young country and New York was divided.  Those who felt they were native Americans did not want immigrants to enter their great country, spawning hatred between groups all over the city where many of them landed.  In the story we see how much of the town is run by one man, with William Cutting (Bill the Butcher, played marvelously by Daniel Day Lewis) being the most feared and wellrespected man of the five Points.Leonardo Di Caprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, who as a boy watched Bill the Butcher kill his father in one of the Points great battles.  Now a grown man, he returns to the Points to find Bill pretty much running the show.  He gets on Bills good side and eventually becomes his number one man, all the while still plotting for his fathers revenge.While there is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore, the film does an excellent job portraying life as it was in New York.  You can be sucked in to the time of the movie, and even though the setting is much before our time you dont need a textbook to understand how things were run and what life was like.Ive never been a big Di Caprio fan, but his effort here (along with his performance from Catch Me If You Can) have made my opinion start to waver a little.  He is good as Amsterdam, and believable in his actions and expressions.  Daniel Day Lewis is simply phenomenal as Bill the Butcher and really should have won the Best Actor Oscar.  Overall, I feel this was the best film of 2002 and really was robbed at the Academy Awards.8 out of 10.",True
"Our Past, Present and Future in 80 Minutes Its so rare that a work of art whether film or dance or theater or visual art can live up to the superlative reviews and the gushing from critics, but IDA is such a work. A relatively short film of only 80 minutes that captures the near past, present and future of Europe in what amounts to a road movie with only two characters. IDA shatters all expectations by making the personal truly political.

"Brilliant and moving An incredible movie that was brilliantly cast. I watched this movie my freshmen year of college and have revisited it time after time. There is never a lull in the movieit hits hard and fast with character shifts and emotional dialogue that never sounds forced coming from the actors mouths. It is the dialogue, transcribed from hundreds of hours of actual interviews with the people of Laramie, that gives this heinous crime a whole new dimension.

"Tension, tension, tension!After seeing Damien Chazelles Whiplash  a film the young upand coming director wished to do for some time now  being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.I believe that among the most telling facts about a films fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden its public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words  a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well.The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesnt derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way.Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our antihero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next Yardbird Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.Expect some awards going in the way of Whiplash and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, thats how good he is in it.And in his own words: What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days.It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it.As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with Whiplash  a precise, tensionbuilding film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top.The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!My grade: 9/10",True
"Gross and dumb I dont think Ive seen this all the way through since it was in theaters when I was 13. I dont remember liking it much then, but Ive long been thinking of rewatching it. Its developed a cult because of its excessive weirdness. It is that excessive weirdness that keeps it watchable. That, the awesome production design, Danny Elfmans score, and Christopher Walken. Without those elements, though, honestly, I dont know that this is all that much better than Batman & Robin (Im not about to rewatch that one, but I did pick up Batman Forever on Blu Ray very cheap along with this  probably both will be a waste of money). If nothing else, it certainly plants a lot of the seeds that would grow into the monstrosity that was B&R. The script here is just awful, first and foremost. Its all just a mess, with all kinds of nutty crap thrown on the screen for little to no reason. Its terribly grotesque. Penguin isnt a rich man in a tuxedo, hes a mutant, and Catwoman is a zombie. It has a really dirty sexual streak. It gets really gross watching Danny De Vito perv all over everyone. Its chock full of terrible oneliners that sound awful even coming out of Michelle Pfeiffer. Batman is more or less forgotten for most of the film. Even when its being aggressively weird, its mostly boring. Walken really livens up the film whenever he appears  his murder of Selina Kyle is by far the highlight of the film. Its a shame he disappears for a long stretch in the second half. The first Burton Batman holds up pretty well. This one, not so much.",False
"Compelling Historical Drama A Royal Affair is a Danish/Swedish/Czech production about the reign of 18th century King Christian VII of Denmark, his Welsh wife and a German physician whose progressive ideas shake Denmarks conservative ruling class to its foundations. As best I can discern the film tries to keep true to actual history with some embellishments added concerning the role of the Queen in the political machinations along with some reasonable speculation about a possible menage a trois. The screenplay by Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg does a nice job of capturing the unusual atmosphere of life at a court governed by a mentally unstable monarch whos little more than a nuisance puppet of the nobility and the church. In the middle of all that is the young English Queen trapped in a loveless marriage. She is also disturbed by the unwillingness of her adopted country to accept the ideas of the Enlightenment then circulating around Europe. Under the direction of Nikolaj Arcel A Royal Affair is an effective recreation of a bygone age yet one in which we can see our contemporary quagmire between those who advocate change and those condemning it. Mikkel Folsgaard is excellent as the King. He never descends to caricature and is both powerful and pitiable. Mads Mikkelsen is compelling as Dr. Johann Struensee a noble but flawed man given a rare opportunity to improve the lot of the lower classes who are suspicious of him as a foreigner usurping the state. Alicia Vikander is Caroline Mathilde a Welsh princess sent to Denmark in an arranged marriage of noble households with no idea of whats in store for her. This is very good intelligent costume drama that should please fans of the genre. Well worth seeing.",False

Bowies songs highlight and punctuate a magical film that is sure to appeal to both the young and young at heart.

"Happiness is where hope goes to die To call Todd Solondzs Happiness a dark comedy is to redefine the words dark and comedy. It hates the world and everyone in it, and takes great pleasure in mocking people stupid enough to try to be happy. In Solondzs world, life is pointless, hope is for suckers, and everybody is basically bad at heart. It says something that the movies most human, sympathetic character is a child molester.And, yes, its a comedy  often a very, very funny one. Funny in a morbid, gallows humor, dead baby joke sort of way, but funny nonetheless.The chief characters in Happiness are all stunted, narcissistic and hopelessly inadequate. Joy (Jane Adams) is a born loser who drifts through a series of menial jobs and drives her boyfriend to suicide; her sister Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) is so selfabsorbed that she thinks her biggest problem is that everyone loves her too much; her neighbor Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) can only connect to people by making obscene phone calls; and Bill (Dylan Baker), his therapist and Joy and Helens brotherinlaw, is a pedophile who rapes two of his 11yearold sons friends. Somehow, Solondz makes these horrible people really, really funny. Like John Waters and the Farrelly Brothers, Solondz finds humor in ugliness and revels in bad taste. He makes sexual dysfunction and personal failure brutally funny; Allens obscene phone calls, for example, are almost endearing in their ineptitude and anatomical incorrectness (Im gonna f*** you in the... ear), while Helens narcissism makes her gloriously clueless (If only I had been raped as a child  then I would know authenticity!). Solondz shows his characters in a clear, satiric light, and it despises them.While Solondz may not like his characters, he does not take the easy way out by making them caricatures. Every one of these awful human beings is a threedimensional character with reasons for being awful.For example, most directors would have made Bill a onenote villain, but Solondz makes him a pitiful monster who is tortured by ghastly sexual urges that he knows are wrong. Theres a tough scene near the end where Bill has a frank talk with his son Billy about his pedophilia, admitting: that he enjoyed raping his victims; that he would do it again; and, while he would not rape his own son, he would jerk off instead. Both father and son are crying  Billy with horror as he realizes just what Bill is, and Bill with shame and despair as he realizes the same thing. Its hard to watch, but its an acting master class and absolutely fearless filmmaking.This is a real actors movie; the cast gives careerbest performances. Baker is both horrifying and heartbreaking as Bill; he squirms in his own skin, as if he is being eaten alive by his own sickness. We pity him, whether we want to or not. Hoffman is hilariously pathetic as Allen, sweating and mumbling with lonely selfhatred. Adams is sad and sweet as the luckless Helen, the closest thing the movie has to a moral center, while Boyle is priceless as the contemptible Helen, swanning around as if waiting for the world to thank her for being born.Happiness is the epitome of acquired taste  its humor is bitter, acidic and often cruel, and it takes real joy in offending the audience. Go elsewhere for a feelgood comedy with a happy ending. If nothing else, though, its a true original, and deserves credit for carving out its own niche in the dark comedy genre.",True
"Too Many Miscellaneous Hitchcockian Nuances In Serious Need of a Mac Guffin What kept me intrigued throughout this thoroughly disappointing venture from the Master is apparently precisely what kept it from being genuinely realized at the time it was made. That is that the profoundly charismatic Cary Grant is required to play two wholly contradictory characters simultaneously. Most of the time, this is executed by having him be his lighthearted, jaunty self on screen and learning suspicious things about him when hes offscreen, until a handful of crucial but ultimately anticlimactic moments at and toward the end. Speaking gingerly of which, a crucial aspect of Hitchcocks genius was that he could make movies where something so not only everyday but so kindly as a glass of milk could become a threatening and ominous peril. In Suspicion, it only makes me wish I were watching another Hitchcock film.Suspicion is about a bashful and unrealistically fragile young woman, played with unseemly melodrama by the otherwise incredibly graceful Joan Fontaine, who marries an enchanting gentleman, only to increasingly suspect him of attempting to kill her. Whatever the truth of the matter should turn out to be, it should be earned through a genuine character arc, not an utterly transparent contrivance rooted in either the audiences unimaginative inability to accept, or the studios ignorant presumption of the audiences unimaginative inability to accept a likable star playing even a potentially menacing character. Either cast this story in a way in which it can be done, or dont do it. If you have to cheat those of us who are mature enough to undertake it for its authenticity in order to appease those who staunchly prefer you take the easy way out, and you are the Master, I would expect you would be prepared to take your artistic integrity seriously enough to evaluate whether or not youre passionate enough about this material to get it made and, if so, fight for it.Hitchcock was the leading exponent of Hollywood and, though not to the brash extent of Preminger or Lang, had the ability to smuggle themes and subjects past the censors, constantly trying the perimeters of the Hays production code, as well as portray themes and subjects in ways so uncanny that the only way they register is purely in the minds of the audience. Watch Revenge, the Hitchhelmed first episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, or reflect on the true nature of the relationship between John Dall and Farley Granger in Rope, to see the zenith of this talent. Even here, in Suspicion, he has the unmarried female mystery writer come for dinner with the Haysgarths one evening with a female companion who wears a manly hairdo, clad in a suit and tie. No reference is ever made of who this character even is or why shes even present; she has no function in the story, hence its plainly cued that she may be the mystery writers lover.This is why I cant understand why Hitch could end up with such a compromised, jagged piece like this. I wont criticize it for being lighthearted in tone, because that is what pulls us along, up to a point. By us I mean we the contemporary audience who is so familiar with Hitchcocks sleight of hand, whether or not we were around when he was still presently releasing films, that his ruse is not just a ruse but a way of cluing us into the fact that there is a ruse afoot, that the wool will be pulled from over our eyes in a matter of time, gradually or suddenly. Potentially, there was a great effect that couldve been had in Suspicion by luring us with the pretense of a blithe romantic plot before the rug is pulled from under us to find sinister goingson, almost akin to Oliver Stones use of genrelinked tone in setting up Born on the Fourth of July. Alas, no such luck. What results is a setup with no payoff because various people for various reasons felt we couldnt handle the payoff.",True
"From portals to orchids, Jonze and Kauffman strike again Three years after director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kauffmans brilliantly offbeat masterpiece Being John Malkovich, comes their latest stream of conscious head trip. Yes folks, this one stars Nicholas Cage...and, Nicholas Cage.The film starts off appropriately enough inside Being John Malkovich(or more precisely on the set of Being John Malkovich when Malkovich is inside his own head) But this is no sequel...no no, much more than that. We soon go back to the beginning. Not the beginning of the movie, but to the beginning of it all. To the dawn of the universe, a zero in the fabric of time itself hurling toward the deep chasm of entropy. From the primitive scribblings of early man to the manic late night scribblings of the neurotic Charlie Kauffman(played by Cage)What we have here is a film about orchid thieves, high society New York socialites, screenwriters, identical twins, crocodiles, narcotic rings, and internet porn...err, more aptly put: a movie about a guy writing a movie about a book inside of another movie. Oh yeah, and its based on a true story. Sound confusing?Adaptation is the screen treatment of the best selling non fiction book The Orchid Thief. Only thing is the main character in the film is doing the adapting, and writing himself into script. In the film we go from early primordial man to Being John Malkovichs floor seven and a half...and somehow it all makes sense.Is this an incoherent parable on the parasitic relationship between writers and their subjects? The evolution from single cell organisms to paleolithic glee? Or a look at how everything seems to have a purpose in life? Somehow between the obscure Hollywood industry injokes, Silence of the Lambs references, and celebrity Boggle tournaments I missed something.
Unfortunately by the third act(when the movie goes from non fiction to fiction) Adaptation unravels and ends up gravely falling apart. But perhaps that is the point. A film about a real life struggle to adapt a book that doesnt have much suspense in it, and the peril of trying to work some fictional thriller plotlines in at the last minute. Either way, hats off to Jonze and Kauffman for once again bringing us an audaciously unconventional idea and tearing down the box. All this from the adaptive skills of an orchid.~.c//0ry",False
"Nobody said his movies werent difficult at times.This is a film occupied with moments. Wonderful moments. It is not so much concerned with mechanics of plot but for me, it never got dull. Wes Anderson has matured in subtle ways and this film is a well crafted blend of the personal and the pageantry  Powell and Pressburger and Cassavetes. The Rules of the Game and Husbands. The Last Detail and The River.The spiritual journey is used as pretext. Some people really dont like this. There is so much humor in watching three brothers stoned on Indian pharmaceuticals, trying to pray and getting sidetracked by arguments over stolen belts and confided secrets. They are flawed. People are flawed. Audiences tend to like their characters so likable that they are bland stereotypes. People can be privileged and disaffected AND still be beautiful and intriguing.In the end, this movie is a fun ride. A stroll through various imaginative carts, occupied by compartments of colorful characters and incidents. Wes is further interweaving his dollhouse aesthetic with the real world. He is not so hung up on inventing every little thing and I could tell he was finding faces and peripheral details just as they were, waiting for him in India.Nine bucks well spent for me. This guys taking chances  some dont work. Hes trying to push the medium forward in terms of tone. Some parts of his movies are difficult. Some people will get left behind. But for me, someone whose watched his films grow in scope and daring, I think hes an American treasure who may never arrive at the perfect film, but hell continue to integrate cinemas history in new and exciting ways.",True
"Something is Missing, Flat Something, hard to define, is missing in this important film. This film takes the viewer on a journey to Selma Alabama at the crucial time of the Civil Rights movement that took place during the life of Martin Luther King. It covers the important facts, describing clearly the sad situation that people of color faced in trying to register to vote in the segregated south. Even today, the efforts by whitedominated election boards make it more and more difficult for people of color to register and make their votes in the old south. The actor playing Dr. King, in my view, is one of the serious problems this film has. He seems to do a good job, but something serious is missing. The fact that he is not an American is part of this problem. There is something artificial about his acting. It is technically sound, yet lacks some deeper presentation of the driven, inspiring personality that defined Dr. King. Perhaps the problem is in the context. We dont really see any sense of the history that lead to this confrontation. The beat down on the bridge is, in my view, poorly filmed and does very little to capture the full outrage, violence and terror of that event. Certainly this is a difficult scene to set up and record, but Hollywood is very wellequipped to do things like this. A lot has been made of the socalled snubbing of Oprah in this film. She has a small part in the beginning of the film, a scene that could have been played by anyone. The scene where she tries to register to vote, while being questioned and intimidated by a series of crazy questions from the voter registrar is very helpful in telling us what this film is about. There is nothing exceptional about her small part, so I see no cause at all for her to imagine that for such a small part she should be nominated for an Academy Award. The very idea seems really childish. A lot of facts were left out, or glossed over; so an enormous opportunity seems to have been lost. Selma is a good film about the civil rights movement, but not a great film. It is flat, the lead actors are not very interesting and the script, in particular, seems half finished. It comes across as a rough draft of an idea for a film rather than a finished product. I was very disappointed in this film. In particular I did not like the actors playing Doctor King or President Johnson. The photography, the camera work, as well was not very good...flat and dry. Perhaps we all have inflated expectations. This is such an important and dramatic story; yet it was created and presented in a very uninspired form with to many missing parts. The part I absolutely did not like at all in any way is the song that closes the film. The semirap composition was very disrespectful and tried much to hard to be relevant. And the fact that it is one of the few points on which it was nominated by the Academy, as best song is just sad.",False
"Breathe deep This is one of the most honest, disturbing yet beautiful explorations of a subject that is all too often oversimplified or dealt with extremely heavyhandily.The way that the abuse is discussed within the characters frozen in time in the main characters psyche, is profound and unflinchingly honest.

"Unconvincing As A Love Story The very heart of this movie is the love story between the rising star Lady Gaga and the jaded drug ridden alcoholic that is Bradley Coopers falling star. On many levels the chemistry just wasnt there, Bradleys convincing method style was fully realised as a train wreck of a man but lacked any real character development, Lady Gagas acting was very on the surface and at some points you could practically see her counting her emotional responses on line and on cue.The emotional responses seemed to be confined between pathetic and hysterical that jarred with Bradleys more nuanced emotional palette. Clearly Gaga devotees will see no fault. The pacing of the movie was laborious at times with any tension evaporating entirely. Two aspects of the movie were worthy of note, firstly the realistic concerts and the documentary nature of the camera work, and lastly, on the whole, the music, it was great fun but not memorable as it was set within an unconvincing movie.",True
"Greatest Movie of All Time Instead of writing a paragraph, Ill give four good reasons why 2001 is  the greatest cinema experience of all time:  1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen.  The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate)  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds  to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL).  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release, it was a favorite trip movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry  Phantom Menace fans!)  2) Kubricks directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such  as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M  and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters faces to give the  audience a psychological viewpoint. Even he uses extreme closeups of  HA Ls glowing red eye to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  wholeheartedly agree with the late Gene Siskles opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although  having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4) The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001s meaning in general is, Id like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie openended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audiences intelligence, Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful  discussion on mans past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great  Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",True
"oh yes, there will be.just got back from an early screening here in san francisco and thought id just lay down a few lines. Mr. Anderson was in attendance but didnt really comment on the film, I would have liked to hear what he had to say, as I have not been so knocked over the head by an American film in so many years. He was humble in his introduction and let the movie speak for itself. It is a near perfect stew of direction, cinematography, score and last but not least, acting. Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely mesmerizing, Paul Dano made me squirm as the wretched young priest. oh my god, i have chills just thinking about both of these performances. they stay with you. a lot of the film reminded me of Terrence malick, though it didnt emulate him. just a nice reminder. i think ill watch days of heaven now. i wish there were more films like this coming out of the states, lets keep our fingers crossed.",True
"Al Pacino is brilliant Dog Day Afternoon tells the true story of Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale). These two guys went into a bank in 1972 in Brooklyn to rob it. They could have been out in five minuted but things went terribly wrong. Instead of a robbery it became a hostage situation. And a media circus as well.From the first second you will be totally in the movie. Afterwards I wanted to write my review and I was not able to remember how the music was, if there was any. It says something about how much the movie grabs you. The first part is very funny, I laughed a lot of times. The second part is more a drama and a thriller. Great director Sidney Lumet creates a certain atmosphere for the movie that is just right. Pacino in one of his best performances is surrounded by a great supporting cast. He was nominated for an Oscar but didnt win it. He lost it to a guy named Jack Nicholson in a movie called One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest. The chances were probably fiftyfifty and the Oscar went to the better movie, I have to admit that. Still, one of the best performances I have ever seen. With any other actor this movie was a nice one, with him it is a great one.",True

"things u should know when walking in that theater. (NOT A SPOILER)This movie was excellent. I thought that it was great camera work and the plot of the story was original as well as captivating. Go see this movie. I went to the screening and Im glad that i waited the 45min outside in the 25 degree weather and then another hour inside the movie theater with a bunch of loud people next to me. Trust me...its worth your money and your time. One word of advice though. This movie is not for people with attention problems. You miss one second of this movie or even a word you might miss the whole object of the movie so just be careful. Jeremy Piven (Buddy Aces Israel) was dramatic as well as freaking hilarious. Ryan Reynolds (Agent Richard Messner) was also a strong dual character. His comedic presence as well as his strong dramatic performance was enough to make this movie a hit in theaters. The rest of the cast are well known actors who each play there own essential role in the movie and make it that much better. I hope you like the movie and my review. This is my first official review on paper but its not my first time writing reviews or watching movies. The movie comes out in theaters on January 26, 2007 so keep an eye out and enjoy.",True
"The secret of Juan JoséIn my country, Juan José Campanella is synonym of cinema of the highest order. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know, dramatically, what were going to watch: Ricardo Darín in an important role, a lot of sentimentalism, references to the countrys past, a love story. And technically, if its the highest order, there wont be any complaints. When the film ended, the people in the movie theater started clapping.El secreto de sus ojos tells the story of Benjamín Esposito (Darín) and his need to tell the story of a case that wasnt completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life. A woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname Morales (Pablo Rago) who went every day to every train station in Buenos Aires to see if he could find the killer. You have to see his eyes; they are in a state of pure love, Benjamín professes in front of Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil); his boss and the woman he loves.There are things we never forget, Campanella knows well, and that might be the films most important declaration. We expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years, as we saw with Darín and Villamil in El mismo amor, la misma lluvia; we expect characters with inner ghosts, things to hide and things to hold on to; we expect total control over the language of the environment (in El mismo amor... it was a magazine staff, in Luna de Avellaneda the neighborhood club), a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for daytoday comedy. In this aspect, the casting of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval is crucial. Taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship. His change of look, the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the years best performances. Thats about everything we can expect. The fact is El secreto de sus ojos is a very good movie because there are things we dont see coming. The film contains a treatment of a police investigation that hasnt been seen in our cinema for years. In his riskiest picture, Campanella flirts with thriller, mystery and real action (handycam included); he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it. He understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters –each of them with a rich, mysterious private and inner world must be seen fully. Its quite embarrassing in fact, because Darín as a director tried to achieve something like that with La señal. Even though its obvious Campanella took no inspiration from that film, everything that went wrong there can be seen here, improved. And Soledad Villamil is no femme fatale. I take a risk, however, and defy you to tell me if, because of image and makeup resemblance, and disposition of images and voice in off, the movie towards the finish line doesnt take direct inspiration from Chris Nolans The Prestige. Its quoting it somehow, at least.Its very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors. Weve seen them on screen so much, we know what they do, we admire them and respect them and, as with Campanella, we tend to know what to expect. However, sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame, with every word in every conversation. Im trying to explain to you the feeling of what Villamil and Darín do in this film: its enchanting and contagious, purely human (as it occurred in El mismo amor...), but at the same time moving, simply because theyre not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film, or young actors with expressive faces, or newcomers that take our breath away: they are Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil. Campanella has a lot to do with this, because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film Ive mentioned.The fact that Fernando Castets didnt write the film calls our attention; the script was written by the director and Eduardo Sacheri. It also calls our attention that Campanella himself edited the movie. Is this filmmaking of the highest order? I believe so, in our country, and speaking of something commercially successful too. Its the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the directors previous work and, who knows, maybe other national pieces.",False
"Amazing.Bad language and violence aside, this is one of the best movies of the 90s! This is actually, a lighthearted police drama with many surprises. One of the surprises is the depiction of small town Arkansas. They may have finally gotten it right! It is slower, safer and more relaxing in comparison to the life that the cops from L.A. have and there isnt any stereotyping that I could find! Another surprise is the performance by Billy Bob. He may be one of the most evil drug dealers I have ever seen on the big screen.A word of caution though. This movie, at least in my opinion, has one of the most violent (not overly graphic, but sadistic) openings to a movie I have seen in a film. The way the murders and tortures are committed are a little hard to watch. But if you get past that, the movie settles down a lot and you really want to see the bad guys get whats coming to them! And the language is extremely rough. I saw the movie again on BRAVO and while there is a lot of silent moments, where they cut out the language, nothing else is cut from the film. A remarkable film.I give this film an A.",False
"Great thriller Jack Terri is a soundman for a Bmovie studio. One night as he is out recording sounds for a film he sees an accident  a car swerves through a guard rail and into a river. Jack jumps in in effort to help and sees that the driver is dead, but he manages to save the passenger. He soon finds out that the driver was the current favorite in the presidential election and after listening to the recording he suspects that what happened was no accident.This is the type of movie many people call a ripoff as not only does it take an idea from a previous story and film (Blow Up) it is one of De Palmas many Hitchcockian efforts. However, under his direction the film feels fresh and moves very well. It is 13 years before John Travolta made Pulp Fiction but he was already a good lead actor. Dennis Franz also gives a good turn as a photographer who knows more than he is telling.However, the scene stealer, would have to be John Lithgow who stoically walks his way through the film as a ruthless killer who wants to remove Jack Terri for the evidence he has. Rarely is such a emotionless and callous role played out so well to such great effect.Then there is De Palmas direction which is the great thing that put all the good stuff together. He has a particular skill of blending shots/scenes without dissolves and that carries the movie is an interesting way. Using shadows, silhouettes, rotating camera shots he is truly a master in good form here. 9/10Rated R: some grisly violence, and profanity",False
"An intelligent piece of work To say that this movie is great or horrible does not begin to define the purest form of emotion that can be drawn from a movie. Schindlers List is the closest thing to poetry that I have ever seen on film. I have always believed that Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were both shafted in the Oscar category, but Oscars are only one year victories. This movie lives on as a testament to the most important event that has occurred during the course of the last century. If I analyzed how to write, direct, film, or orchestrate a film of this kind of magnitude, then I would know how to make classics, which Schindlers List is. Steven Spielberg is an artist...both in entertainment and in realism. This is a film which I have not seen for many years and decided to see again to see if it had the same impact that it had when I was younger. Now 21, I truly understand the message he was attempting to get across. It was that one man can understand the value of life through the violence and pain that surrounded him as he attempted to profit from it. Seeing it again also reestablished my acknowledgement that this is one of my most favorite films of all time. A true 10 on my scale.",False
"Absolutely amazing.I was lucky enough to see this at the Austin Film Festival and was absolutely blow away.Aronofsky is, in many ways, like Nick Cave. You know going in that you are going to get something gritty, raw, and real. You know that, even if its good, its going to be hard to process. But when he gets a hold of something, really gets a hold of it, you wont be able to look away, no matter how hard it is to watch. He is a singular filmmaker in the regard that he can create something that is both visceral and cerebral at the same time. Others can do this, but few as well. What he does is never hollow, shallow, or empty, it is always dense, deep, and rich with everything that makes film great.Black Swan is no exception. In many ways this is the most Aronofsky of his films. His style is spot on and works exquisitely with the world he is presenting. Its surprising because he normally shows the dirty, gritty, and ugly places, where as everything in this film is clean and polished. But dont let that fool you, he saved the dirt and grit for the characters. Its remarkable that the man who was able to show the sensitive, and vulnerable side of a wrestler is also able to show the brutal and hard side of a ballerina? For starters, this film looks amazing. The production design, specifically the use of black and white in contrast (dont spend time looking for this, its everywhere and you will miss something if you do) does its job without feeling invasive. The lighting is brilliant, as is the staging of the dance scenes. Im still stunned that the same eye that brought the grainy subway bathroom of Pi to life is the same eye that brings all this rich and beautiful color so clearly to the screen.He also does a brilliant job of creating the world that these characters inhabit. This film reminded me of all the terrible parts of my theater days. The backstabbing, the trash talking, and the two faced nature of that world is portrayed with a deft and brilliant touch. There is a constant fear that you are one mistake away from losing not only your part, but your future parts as well. You feel like you are a part of this world, that he pressure of it is part of your world.The camera work is great, if a little typical of Aronofsky at times (we see the backs of heads quite a bit, it works, but you see it a lot), but it is very affective. The somewhat jittery, close handheld shots are perfect and pull you deeper into this world than may be comfortable.Then there are the name performances. Of the name actors you mostly get what you expect. Portman, Cassel, Hershey, and Rider are outstanding. The only real shock, for me anyway, is Mila Kunis. I know her as Jackie from That 70s Show, and nothing else. She damned near steals the show. Thats right, in a move where she shares screen with Natalie Portman, AND Vincent Cassel she is able to not only hold her own, but walk away with some scenes. The interplay between her wild, unrestrained Lilly, and Portmans frightened, tightly wound Nina creates a brilliant external tension to match, and at times overpower, the internal tension that lies at the very core of Nina.I have been a fan of Aronofskys work since I saw Pi on its original theatrical run ( I think I was the only person in the theater for that midnight show), and he has yet to disappoint. He has a definite point of view and a thematic core that runs through his work. Thematically, this is in keeping with most of Aronofskys work. Its about control and the loss of that control. What happens when a perfectionist control freak is in a position where she HAS to let go of that control? What takes over when she does let go? In typical fashion, Aronofsky shows us that sometimes in striving to get what we want, we risk losing a part of us that we may never be able to get back, and dont realize how desperately we need.Read more from me at www.thefilmthugs.com",True
"Excellent expose of narcissism on two sides of the same coin A womans take on this is probably not the same as a mans. Initially I was put off by Charles Haydens Churchs character crudeness and Giamattis characters repulsiveness but that changed was I was able to look below the surface. By the end of the movie, I felt very sorry for Church as he was not only dumb and shallow, he was actually so empty that whatever female was before him became a mirror of his need to connect with anything that felt like caring. Church did a fabulous job and was incredibly believable as a hasbeen wannabe, desperate to hold on to his dream of the kind of good life that is bought by charm and good looks. He is just on the edge or realizing his time is running out and that is a whole lot for this character to absorb as he has never given much to the concept of thought.Giammeti is a pitiful, selfabsorbed, destructive, depressed alcoholic whose in possession of two things. He knows a great deal about wine and he has written a book. Nothing else informs him. Yet his performance is so nuanced that we are able to fill in his depth of character and decency primarily through his huge, limpid eyes. What a performance. He should have been nominated for an academy award. This is a role that comes along onceinalifetime for this type of character actor, like Liza in Cabaret.The women are really nothing more than backdrops or props for the men to expose themselves. Madsen is lovely but you do wonder what on earth she really sees in this man. While he may be redeemable, he is really pretty much a selfabsorbed jerk. It is most interesting that this film has been released at the same time as Closer, as they are similar in their exploration of selfabsorption. Though Closer explores how destructive its characters are to each other, in the end, Closer is not as intimate and seems more artificial than the sweetly revealing Sideways.",False
"So terrible, yet....My friend and I had a blast at this movie last Friday, but not for the reason you would expect. We literally laughed through the entire film  and what was even more fun was that the entire theater was laughing, too. The dialogue and plot were so thin and badly written, and the intense scenes so implausible, that it was hilarious. As the movie ended, I think all of us sat staring at the screen wondering if that really was the ending  that the credits were about to prove it was all over  that me, my friend, and the entire theater, cracked up all over again.So, I have absolutely no regrets about paying money to see it.

"My Favorite Of The Harry Potter Films I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. Thats my feeling, and Im still sticking to it.This was just great fun, right from the opening. In fact, the early bus scene is the best in the film. Overall, the movie didnt have as mean an edge to it as the others, although it has a number of scary moments (which might have warranted a PG13 rating). That was fine with me. I got tired of the dark, nasty and/or annoying characters of the first two films, and especially the irritating blonde wiseguy kid. I give this major points for cutting his role down. Even Alan Rickmans character softens.In other words, there is no despicable villain to hate throughout the film, which I thought was refreshing. Instead, we just go through one adventure after another until the final surprise ending.Along the way are a lot of fun special effects and scenery, some humor (Emma Thompson is a hoot as an eccentric tealeaf reader) and some fantastic 5.1 surround sound. I wish all the Harry Potter films were like this one.",True
"What is Truth?The infamous words spoken by Pilate to Jesus of Nazareth come to mind when one ponders the life of John Edgar Hoover. Was he a genius or a tyrant? A patriot or a dictator? A cross dresser or an uptight man with no sex life? Nobody knows for certain, and director Clint Eastwood does not offer a definitive answer to any of these questions, which is exactly as it should be. Life is rarely cutanddried, but moviegoers seem to have forgotten that fact in the face of media that state speculation as fact on a regular basis.I find it not only surprising, but distressing, that a major criticism from those critics who panned the film is the lack of closure on Hoovers private life. Unless they are truly obtuse, they must realize that no film could possibly do such a thing, since his files were destroyed at his own bidding. All is speculation, and a fine speculation it is. Leonardo Di Caprio is superb (as usual) in the title role, never revealing more cards then he chooses to at any given moment. He receives fine support from Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson, Hoovers Second in Command/Rumored Lover, and Naomi Watts as his endlessly loyal private secretary Helen Gandy. At a time when red fever ran high, Hoovers relentlessly tightening control on government investigations is shown in flashbacks that only underscore how supreme power can corrupt even the noblest of intentions.In the end, the film answers none of the questions that seem so important to the very critics that disliked it, but in my humble opinion, a well made film is one that inspires debate or discussion rather than simply hand down a definitive this is the way it was with an imperious gavel.

"A film that will stay with you My first thought when I finished watching this film was, `I cant believe I really enjoyed a film that starred a Culkin.  My subsequent conclusions about the film were not as easily reached.When I decided to watch this film, I was expecting The Royal Tennenbaums: Part 2.  Rich family, the story takes place in a big city, eccentric characters.  While both films share these elements, they are very different in that I considered The Royal Tennenbaums to be mostly a comedy; while Igbys few comedic moments are so dark one almost feels badly for chuckling. What this film is really about is family, but not just in the traditional sense. (What is more traditional than a disapproving mother who is more concerned about herself than anyone else in the family, a clinically schizophrenic father, and two brothers: the elder a narcissist (if not practical) and the younger, a rebellious 16 year old who is forced to change schools more often than most of us change our Glade Plug Ins.) It is about family in any sense: Friends, strangers, anyone Igby encounters and tries to gain acceptance from.  Culkins Igby, who looks like a waifish Harry Potter without the `imp factor, is an extremely conflicted character.  We have seen rebellious types portrayed ad nauseum in films for decades, but it is a rare occasion when this person is both sympathetic and extremely intelligent.  The character draws you in enough that you actually want to know why he acts the way he does, and you truly want him to find happiness.  Unfortunately, it appears that when a door opens, it slams just as quickly.  Culkin is truly fantastic in this role.  He shoulders a character that is both intelligent enough to defend himself, yet vulnerable enough to give the impression of fragility.  The rest of the cast is also decent, particularly Jeff Goldblum as D.H., a larger than life character who is conflicted in his own right. The story was just complicated enough to keep me very interested, while endearing and thoughtprovoking enough for me to reflect on it long after it was over.  Im not entirely sure who I would recommend this film to, but if you are looking for a thoughtprovoking drama with some great acting, dialogue and story line I would definitely check this movie out.  It has received some rave reviews and I believe they are welldeserved.",False
"Caustic, cynical examination of the inner workings of the film industry While through the ages, many noteworthy motion pictures detailing the film industry itself have been made, the majority concentrated on a highly positive tone, portraying Hollywood as the organization which brought dreams to life, or similar self serving platitudes. However, in the early 90s, a new trend began to emerge  films which delved below the glossy exterior of Hollywood and began to expose more negative aspects of the industry. One would be hard pressed to find as fitting an example of this Hollywood introspective neo realism as writer/director George Huangs semiautobiographical (but hopefully only to an extent...) Swimming With Sharks  a biting, cynical look at the interior of the film industry which challenges the preconceptions of the industry and its bleak aims.Like Robert Altmans The Player, Swimming with Sharks offers a harshly critical commentary on the corporate moneymaking machine that is Hollywood, but from the opposite end: the perspective of a low level assistant striving to rise in the ranks. However, similar to Altmans work, Huangs film dabbles with the notion of being a black comedy or darkly satirical take on the business end of the film industry, but ultimately lacks the acerbic wit needed to succeed on such a front. As such, while the occasional moment of darkly gleeful comedic insight may derived, for the most part, the film falters on attempted darkly ironic comedic moments which come across as too heavy handed to be truly funny. The films main strength is in its strictly dramatic climax; its harrowing and powerful turn of events toying with notions of all consuming ambition and free will in a truly gripping fashion. Combined with a numbingly unexpected and chilling ending scene, the films finale is easily its strongest point  enough so to carry the occasional botched comic moment from earlier in the film. However, Tom Heils understated and affecting single piano score and the occasional moment of intriguing cinematography also add to the overall quality of the work. Kevin Spacey is the main pleasure to behold here as the films main selling point, the boss from Hell figure Buddy Ackerman. Alternating between wryly funny, starkly powerful and disconcertingly human, Spacey, though disappointingly denied the ability to chew the scenery quite as much as one might hope for, easily walks away with the picture with his top notch work. Frank Whaley gives an adequate performance as the constantly put upon assistant who finally seeks revenge, though his character is given next to no development and Whaley lacks the engaging charisma needed to really sell the role. Michelle Forbes also comes across as disappointingly flat as an ambitious business woman caught between Spacey and Whaley, though she shines in certain scenes. Watch also for an early appearance by Benicio Del Toro in a tiny role as Whaleys predecessor. While it may falter as the black comedy it clearly wants to be throughout, the film excels as the harshly critical drama it becomes by the end. An undeniably maliciously enjoyable performance by Spacey keeps the film afloat, and while it may occasionally come across as lopsided or falling short of its potential, Swimming with Sharks keeps enough surprises up its proverbial sleeve to remain interesting throughout as a cynical treatise on ambition and the film industry which thrives upon it. 7/10",False
"Gyllenhaal at his Best Nightcrawler from the very beginning is not a traditional Hollywood film. It certainly does not follow the narrative of one and even though it has the threeact structure we are all familiar with, it spins them around. This is particularly evident in the third act, incredibly suspenseful with a brilliant, almost anticlimax. Suspense is the main key to this films success, it build and builds to the point where the last twenty minutes of the film are completely unpredictable. Dan Gilroy in his directorial debut here has shown a real understanding of how to keep an audience engaged and following a character who isnt an easy man to spend a great deal of time with. Gilroys screenplay is fast paced and one of the finest this year. The script focuses the audience on the characters, Louis Bloom particularly yet the supporting characters are just as impressive by Bill Paxton and Rene Russo alike. It doesnt follow the rules of a typical script, we are introduced instantly to a criminal and this man is supposed to be our protagonist. Yet what becomes clear is that there is not a protagonist in Nightcrawler, Jake Gyllenhaals Louis Bloom is the antagonist. He can be described as nothing less than a psychopath and his portrayal by Gyllenhaal is one of his greatest performances. He is very gaunt here, losing a lot of weight for the role, however that is not the main reason for his impressive performance. Gyllenhaal is an actor who continues to impress me; his work in Enemy from earlier this year was just as brilliant. He has chosen excellent roles in films such as Zodiac, Prisoners and End of Watch. The cinematography is also fantastic, nighttime LA has not looked this good since 2011s Drive. All these elements come together to make a captivating piece of filmmaking, a film I expect will be discussed more as time goes on.",True
"Money isnt everything The paragraph describing this film said it was about a group of people who come together when Mum locks herself out. This is misleading as that is only a small part of the film , there is much more to it than that, I saw this film as part of a Mike Leigh feature on TV.I straight away recognised Philip Davis who also stared in Mike Leighs Grown Ups even though it was 20 years earlier that I had seen that. He looked very similar but his character, Cyril was much better tempered than Dick had been. Cyril and his partner Shirley are the only ones who seem to care about poor old Mum. They are also kind hearted enough to help out a stranger who was lost and confused. Her other daughter Valarie appears to care more about her dog and her own life. The toffee nosed couple next door would rather leave the poor old women standing out in the cold when she locks herself out and dont want anyone to get in the way of their life.
This film lets us see that having money doesnt always mean happiness. Cyril and Shirley are much more contented than their richer neighbours and sister. They are also much less selfish. I would rather have them any day",True
"Among Altmans Best The daytoday lives of a number of suburban Los Angeles residents.In many ways, this film is a followup to Altmans Nashville, another story of several people (twentyfour) going about their day in Nashville. How many characters are in this story of folks in Los Angeles? Probably about the same.If anything, this story strikes me as better. Better scripted, for sure, and with much more mystery and suspense (and more dead bodies). We have an incredible cast: Tom Waits and Jennifer Jason Leigh steal the show, but Robert Downey, Tim Robbins, Chris Penn and a dozen others are amazing, too.",True
"Entertaining story, even when not in for a feelgood comedy. Moving from time to time The theater announced this movie as a feelgood comedy, which did me hesitate a bit before buying tickets. When before the TV at home, such comedies make me cringe mostly, due to overacted family ties and an emphasis on life events that should bind people together (but not always do). However, the synopsis of this film sounded intriguing. Also, the reviews on IM Db contradicted each other heavily. The latter decided for me.Neither the family situation nor the line of events will match everydays and everyones family life. But the deviation from a standard family carries the story throughout the movie, and makes up the basic ingredients for the dramatic part. I disagree with many reviewers, who have serious problems with the logic in the story. They seem to think that there is only black and white in sexual preferences, and no gray areas in between that one could try for a shorter or longer period.The casting is convincing, and the actors are performing very well. The composition of the story is such that there is never a dull moment, and there is always some unexpected event around the corner for our entertainment.Three sex scenes are included in the film, and one could argue that these could have been more implicit, to make it suitable for family viewing and still drive the message home what happened and what it entails for the story. On the other hand, what is actually shown on the screen is not worse than what one can stumble upon during Internet browsing or home watching TV.The only problem I had with the story that it has a happy ending for most of the main characters, but not all. I have pity with the ones who were left more or less empty handed. They would have deserved it if they had behaved badly in some sense, but they certainly were not.I saw this film as part of the Deventer humor festival 2010 (Deventer is a medium sized village in The Netherlands). I dont think it had its place there, as the movie is much more dramatic than it is hilarious. I can only assume that the festival programmer had other reasons to make it part of this event. Nevertheless I have no complaints about having seen this movie, all things considered.",False
"I never get tired of watching this movie I  have seen this movie more times than I can count! Whenever it is on cable, I watch it and I have purchase the CD as well. As an only child of a single mother, I can relate to what Jason felt as a child. As an adult now, I can relate to the challenges that Beverly must have faced. Drew Barrymore is amazing and believable. The actors who played Jason at various points in his life added so much comedy to the movie. Some of my favorite scenes are with Drew and the reallife brothers who portrayed 4 and 7year old Jason. I admire Drew so much for putting her heart and soul into this moviea real movie that explores the sometimes complex relationship between children and their mothers.",True
"Theyre Filming Midgets......in Bruges. Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin Mc Donagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.The dark comedy built around the existential quandaries of hit men has been done to death over the years. If last summers You Kill Me was the relentlessly dark and relentlessly sitcomy take on the genre, then In Bruges is the hipster art film take on the theme. Mc Donagh deserves all the credit in the world for breathing life into the stale story by texturing the tonal shifts with crisp digital camerawork (that is surprisingly haunting), deep character development, and by creating a wonderful sense of place. Imagine a Graham Greene novel (Brighton Rock specifically comes to mind) modernized by David Mamet. The dialog is super smart and wickedly un PC while the comedy parts are as gutbusting as the crime thriller parts are suspenseful.Mc Donagh has also brought together an outstanding cast who thrive in the material. Farrell defies all odds and manages to be as sympathetic in the dramatic parts as he is charmingly sarcastic in the comedic parts. Brendan Gleeson gives a fantastically nuanced portrayal as Farrells mentor and friend. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes channels the scaryashell energy hes used previously in Schindlers List and the recent Harry Potter films in a limber subversion that is a frighteningly fun to watch. The supporting cast is to die for, with Jordan Prentice spoton as a cokedup dwarf actor shooting an abhorrent art film on the streets of Bruges, and Clemence Poesy coyly seductive and unforgettable as Farrells unlikely local love interest.Ultimately In Bruges meanders down too many cobblestone paths, and one scene near the end involving a bell tower stretches credibility but adds necessary dramatic effect. Certain plot elements will turn off a large segment of the viewing audience. However, those with the right mindset will be greatly rewarded. In Bruges is hilarious, contemplative, sometimes scathing, often nihilistic, but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in Mc Donaghs insightful light. The arrival of a commanding talent has been heralded...in Bruges.",True
"What film making is about This is incredibly entertaining and solid piece of film making, by Scott Frank. The film travels on a road that its laid out for the audience to see steps ahead, but that never matters, b/c you are constantly in suspense over what will happen to the incredibly well drawn characters in the film. Frank also shows tons of directorial flair to accompany his writing prowess. The whole cast was amazing, Matthew Goode is completely unrecognizable and is perfect in the film. Jeff Daniels again dons a Beard and steals his scenes, every line of his dialog either makes you laugh, think or just compels the movie forward, and Joseph Gordon Levitt again proves why he is capable of being one of the next great movie stars. Go see this movie and tell your friends to do the same.This is the kind of film Hollywood should be making,",False
"The people are the story Queen of Katwe goes far beyond the usual cliché movie: underdog overcomes adversity to win championship. Here, wonderful actors depict real people struggling with the realities of their lives: single motherhood, overcoming poverty, feeling out of place, and the challenges of playing high level chess. Particularly compelling is the story of Phionas mother who lost her husband and struggles to provide for four children by selling cooked maize in the market. The actress who portrays her depicts her strength, and also her limitations with integrity. A wonderful performance. Of course, Phionas story as a chess prodigy from the slums of Katwe, Uganda is harrowing, inspiring and insightful. The movie doesnt settle for a trophy as the outcome, focusing on the impacts on Phiona and her family along the way. The story of Phionas coach is as inspiring as her story. His sacrifices, his wifes sacrifices and his challenges providing for his family as he tries to help the children of Katwe is a movie unto itself. Thats why the whole thing is so satisfying. It is an amazing story of real people, only lightly changed for filmmaking, well acted and compelling.",False
"Infinity is a sympathetic but rousing film on one of the greatest minds of all time – Srinivasa Ramanujan.Before Albert Einstein there was Srinivasa Ramanujan  A little known fact outside India and the academic community, and precisely why this story had to be told. The Man Who Knew Infinity serves as a biopic behind the life and times of Ramanujan, a selftaught Indian Mathematician, who some say could decipher the very fabric of existence. Its a poignant film in as much as an emotional roller coaster but an extraordinary story told almost a century after Ramanujans early and tragic death in 1920.Thats because Ramanujan was not only a mathematical prodigy by the age of 11, or that he could mentally compute complex permutations in a fraction of a second, but the fact that at the height of his powers, not many could fathom his genius. Not even the Cambridge scholars who elected him as a Fellow of the Royal Society and also a Fellow of Trinity College – monumental achievements for an Indian with no formal training in mathematics. Based on this true story and adapted from a 1991 book of the same name, writer/director Matthew Brown begins the film in 1914 Madras (back when Madras was rightly called Madras). Ramanujan (Dev Patel) comes from a poor Brahmin upbringing where even note paper is a luxury. He is seen frantically scribbling theorems on slate before sending samples of his work to intellectuals in Cambridge. Within an instant of receiving the latters theories, Cambridge academic G. H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) is not only astounded, but invites Ramanujan to study in England – both as his protégé and the missing link since Isaac Newton.Forced to leave behind his young wife (Devika Bhise) with his mother, this would be the start of many of his problems but not before going on to make profound discoveries in his field of study. Close on the heels of The Theory of Everything and The Imitation Game, 2014s Academy Award frontrunners, Browns screenplay fits the bill as a rousing film with a lot of heart but not much insight. Instead, its more of a sympathetic look at Ramanujans poor background and the hardships he would encounter in England, including what looks like an over exaggerated and clichéd case of racial prejudice and a depressing long distance love story with his wife. What this means is Infinity is still a wellmade film worthy of a thunderous applause, but does little to focus on Ramanujans innate brilliance. However, from a storytelling perspective thats not really the directors fault. Consider the fact that almost a century after his death, intellectuals using modern day computers are still baffled by Ramanujans integrals and integers. And only as recent as 2012 have scientists confirmed Ramanujans incredible intuition that suggests the existence of black holes in deep space – a concept that was virtually unknown during his time.Intuition is Ramanujans answer to how he arrives at his conclusions, and the best moments in the film where Hardy forces Ramanujan to provide proofs, or sequential steps to his formulae. Without proofs his theories are considered inconceivable and Ramanujan is often dismissed as a charlatan. To its merit, Infinity builds on the relationship between Hardy and Ramanujan, both extreme opposites in their beliefs but recluses who find solace and then inspiration in each other. Irons is perfectly cast as an outspoken atheist opposite Patel who believes his theories come from God. Their symbiotic chemistry builds towards a tearjerker of an ending while adding warmth and closure. Given that Ramanujan was known to be short and stout, Patel might seem like a strange casting choice yet captures his character with integrity and passion and in some ways, a beefier underdog akin to his breakout role in Slumdog Millionaire.That The Man Who Knew Infinity is aimed as a crowd pleaser is obvious and it works well within this scope. And given the subject matter, this film should also do well in foreign markets, especially multiplexes in the Subcontinent and surrounding regions. Whats more important, and hopefully so, is that the film brings out Ramanujans true legacy shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Newton and Einstein. Time, as infinite as itself, will tell.",False
"Interesting Take on a Surprisingly True Story,Pain & Gain is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that have the ability both serious and funny which made them great casting for a movie I like this.Although it is very hard to believe,this is actually based on a true story,and as the movie continues it becomes more and more unbelievable,but are robed every now and again that it is actually a true story,which was clever because they obviously knew people would be thinking that throughout.This movie has different characters narrating throughout,which is something I have complained about in past reviews,I just think we should only be following one character,and when we learn about a different characters past it should still be the main character telling their story,I think it should have just been Mark Wahlbergs character telling the story instead of switching around to Dwayne Johnson,to Bar Paly and later on Ed Harris,they gave so much characters the chance to narrate which just really irritates me.The movie really is a breath of fresh air considering it is directed by Michael Bay,whos never done a movie like this before,and the characters are nothing like Mark Wahlberg,Dwayne Johnson or Anthony Mackie have played before. Pain & Gain is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or comedy.Based on a true story about three bodybuilders who get involved in burglary and kidnapping in order to get all the money and wealthy lifestyle they desire,but to fact that none of them are particularity brainy dosent help them.

"One of the Years Best Gone Baby, Gone is one of the best films of the year. It is being compared to Mystic River and The Departed because it takes place in Boston, but I actually liked it better than either of those films.The opening credits start with the camera showing close ups of peoples faces. The close ups are a recurring theme throughout the movie. Its because this is not just a film about a child kidnapping. It is a film about people and that is what lifts this film above so many others.Director Ben Affleck shows confidence and style in his first film. After this, he does not need to perform in any more films. He is a much better writer and director than he is an actor.All the performances in the film are superb. Casey Affleck has to carry the film and he does a great job. He is a stoic, deadpan, detective. But unlike the Noir detectives of the past, he is not a loner. He has a lot of friends and he has his girlfriend played by Michelle Monaghan help with the investigation. He uses his connections to find out things the police cannot.Beyond that, the less you know the better.If you like crime dramas that also work as character studies, you should run out and see Gone Baby, Gone.",False

"Black and White and Gray All Over Billy Bob Thornton has the perfect face for film noir.  His craggy, drawn features lead up to sunken but large and staring eyes, and cheeks that look to be made out of plaster.  Particularly when shot in black and white, his face becomes a landscape of shifting shadows, while he doesnt move a muscle.  He is able to give the impression of a man at war with himself even while sitting perfectly still and staring ahead.  Hes Jeremy Irons, only without that unsettling accent.  The Coen brothers take great advantage of their stars granite physiognomy throughout The Man That Wasnt There, constructing several shots around Thornton staring into a point just slightly away from the camera, impassive as an Easter Island head, moving only to smoke an everpresent cigarette while the obligatory noir voiceover narration runs.  His voice is perfect, too: a kind of calm, measured rumbling, which describes incredible events but never seems amazed by them. Thornton says I dont talk much, and its true: he doesnt do much either, but he is still fascinating, and commands our attention.The Coens take great relish in the noir conventions, even beyond the 1940s setting and the black and white photography (lets face it, were so used to 40s movies in black and white that color would look a little weird).  The story follows classic lines (with a few wild divergences): Thorntons character is a barber in one of those small postwar California towns that Hitchcock was so enamored of.  He comes up with a scheme to raise some money, which naturally spins a little beyond what he anticipated.  Thats all I can say in good conscience, and the plot goes pretty far afield (I mean REALLY far afield, catering to fans both of Dashiell Hammett and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers).  But really, you know what to expect, if youve ever seen one of these movies before: greed, dark secrets, and murder, in a world of fedoras, cigarette smoke, snapping lighters, and deep moral turpitude.  A world where nothing or no one is what they seem, and the only sure thing is that, in the end, some sap is gonna get it.As good as Thornton is, he cant carry the movie alone.  Fortunately, he is surrounded by a topnotch cast, including a lot of familiar Coen veterans, and it is this that really makes this movie work.  Michael Badalucco puts in a hilarious turn as Thorntons gabby brotherinlaw, Frances Mc Dormand is effective in her relatively few scenes as his brittle wife, and James Gandolfini plays yet another boorish tough guy to a turn.  Practically shoplifting the movie is Tony Shalhoub, playing a fasttalking Sacramento lawyer who doesnt so much speak as summate.  His discussion of Heisenberg is almost worth the ticket price alone.  Christopher Kriesa and Brian Haley get a lot of mileage out of their brief appearances as a pair of slightly dim cops (arent they all in these movies?)Joel Coen, who directed, makes sure that the movie is consistently interesting to watch, too.  Black and white photography being mostly about shades of gray, noir is perhaps the only genre that benefits from the relative primitiveness of its visual technology.  Coen, therefore, sticks with it, unlike the colors he used in the 30s themed O Brother Where Art Thou? which managed to be both more fanciful and less surreal than this movie.  He uses the lightandshadow character of black and white to great effect here, carefully crafting his images to make best use of it.  In fact, if the movie has a fault, its that the images are a little TOO carefully crafted.  The purest noir was cleverly filmed, but it allowed its cleverness to seep into the background.  You have to watch a few times to pick up on how sharp the filmmaking is.  Coen is unable to hide his arty cleverness, and so in the end, fun as it is to watch, the movie is a bit too pretty to truly capture the essence of its forbears.  Perhaps realizing this, the Coens tweak the conventions mercilessly, and inject a streak of humor that is funnier for being played so straight (there are lots of funny lines, but dont be surprised if you are the only one in the theater laughing. Actually, dont be surprised if you are the only one in the theater, period.)  The movie does require a bit of patience; the pacing is intense but quite slow, and the story wanders like a drunk driver.  In the end, it is somewhat debatable whether the twisty plot is fully resolved, or whether that even matters.  The Man That Wasnt There is best viewed as a wicked cinematic joke, and in that regard, it succeeds, in (Sam) spades.But what do I know?  Im just some sap.",False
"What a Gem.What an Gem, perfect. There arent many movies where its 99%, two characters talking that holds my attention and sounds real. Its was sort of like Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (without the crazy) in dealing with the challenges of a modern romantic relationship. Justin Long is amazing. I dont understand why hes not a huge star. But, perhaps thats a good thing. His performance in Hes not that into you was great he was the best thing about that movie. He may not be the typical leading man, but he has a soulful, honest quality that comes across.Emma Rossum was lovely. Ive only seen her in Shameless,which she is wonderful in.

"Very mixed emotions here.Got to be honest, I did not get what was going on. Im thinking perhaps Im just too old to understand whats going on in the minds of teenagers, though at the same time, I do remember times as a teenager when I left like just letting go. The movie is based on actual events. A small town in the south of Whales that has had a high suicide rate among teenagers from 2007 2012 and no explanation was given for why this was happening as the teens killed themselves without giving one. It looks like the filmmakers are trying to make as real of a narrative as possible to what was going on in the town. Exploring the day to day lives of these kids as they attempt to live their lives to the fullest until one day they just decide they dont want to anymore.I did like the look of the movie, and how it flowed. The main character, Sara was great to look at, I loved her interactions with other characters such as Thomas and Jamie, it was beautiful to watch and felt very natural, just a bunch of kids connecting. Also felt the music greatly added to the film. Bridgend really feels like the filmmakers are running the events through their heads to find an answer themselves to whats going on but never do. Bridgeend works without a plot, which does not work for me. The movie is met for a certain type of person and Im definitely not that person its trying to reach and I just have to except that. I did like the cinematography the art direction and the acting, but the concepts do not reach me and because of that I needed the answer these kids could not find.",True
"An excellent study of characters with a strong sense of place.A very intelligent script, with direction that does it justice. Rather than spelling out exactly what were supposed to be thinking and feeling at every moment, the filmmakers respect the audiences ability to infer meaning from the mood and tone, from the light in a frame or the ambient noise of a scene (or, for that matter, from the complete silence in which we occasionally are allowed to contemplate the house and small town where the story is set). As for the actors, they must have been thrilled to have the chance to play such complex, wellrounded characters, each of them at times being fine and even something like noble, at other times frustrating and perhaps even cruel. Just like real people, in other words. Amy Adams deserves the praise shes received for a role that could have easily been a caricature, but Id like to also mention Embeth Davidtz for her precise and empathetic work in another part that might have easily been done in a hackneyed way.All through this film, there are moments where we fear that its makers are going to settle for the cliché, but they never do. By the end, we feel that weve learned a great deal about the characters and the community which produced them, and we also sense that well never fully grasp all of their mysteries and contradictions. Very fine work from everyone involved.",True

"Superb mafia drama. Deeper, and rings truer than most.First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most. Its cinematography may not have the moody, noirish atmosphere that makes The Godfather so appealing, but despite its slick Hollywood look, it seems to attain such penetrating truth (this, perhaps, has a little to do with its being based on a book by the real life main character). The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent, and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one. The performances are absolutely superb. Particularly the two men who the story centres on, Joe Pistone, a.k.a Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, going for realism in this role, is incredible. It begins and ends with a closeup of his eyes  this movie would be nothing without him) and mafia man Lefty (Pacino, who gives us one of his finest characterisations  best bit, his closeup after Donnie is asked to shake hands by a certain character on a certain boat). The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay (again, credit to the reallife source material). Recurring catchphrases make it easy for us to get to know characters, and wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance, and make it ring true: like Leftys smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out, and the portrait of Lefty, the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran, as a vulnerable, often emotional man.Deserves at least four stars.

"Must See After two women are found dead in a rural community, a detective arrives from the big city to help out. Things quickly mushroom with the discovery of more bodies, more suspects and no end in sight.Whether you like police films or not you should see this movie about the real hunt for Koreas first known serial killer simply because its a great movie. This is a movie that alters your expectations and changes your view of things. Its impossible to guess whats going to happen simply because the twists and turns are so unexpected. At times this is a funny funny movie, especially if you like shows like Law and Order or CSI since what we take for granted in those shows is stood on its head. At other times this is a very taut thriller and you become as desperate as the police in needing to put an end to the madness.On top of all of this is a picture of Korea in 1986, a place with political unrest and civil defense drills that for me at least makes it seem like something out of the 1950s.This is brilliant brilliant filmmaking.Ive given the film an 8 out of 10, even though it probably deserves to be higher, simply because some 12 hours after seeing the film, Im still pondering what I thought of it, how good is it? At least an 8. Im sure a second and third and fourth viewings will change my mind.Yea its that good",False
"Wahlbergs Corner In many ways, The Fighter is the film of 2011. A family drama with a pugilistic background. The punches, physical and emotional in and out of the ring took me completely by surprise. What didnt surprise me was Mark Wahlbergs signature all over the place. Let me explain: Many years ago I was at a lecture by director Martin Donovan when during the Q&A somebody made fun of the fact that Calvin Klein underwear model Marky Mark had played a part (his first acting role) in Donovans made for TV The Substitute Donovan with elegance, wit and firmness destroyed the guy asking the question, describing Wahlbergs strengths and ended up saying Mark Wahlberg will be one of the top actors around and he will probably be running Hollywood within a decade I had Donovans words buzzing in my ears when I sat speechless watching Boogie Nights. Wahlberg also produced Entourage and the startling In Treatment. He now produced The Fighter and his performance, interior and powerful, dominates the film allowing other members of the cast, to shine in truly showy roles, Christian Bale for instance  really good. Melissa Leo is a stand out as the mother/manager. Superb. So I wont be surprised to see Mark Wahlberg receiving the top honors at the next Academy Awards, as an actor and producer. He certainly deserves it. Bravo!",True
"**** Endlessly charming I first saw this film as a preteen and have loved it ever since. Endlessly entertaining performances are the best thing about this underrated and understated comingofage comedy that features Cher doing what she does bestconvincing you she rules the world, and she really does. As Rachel Flax, a headstrong and independent mother of two (Winona Ryder, Christina Ricci), she thinks nothing of jumping into her car at the slightest sign of trouble and moving to another town (Life is change, she says). Ryder is excellent as the fifteen yearold Charlotte, a girl who thinks that the best way to fight her burgeoning hormones is to devote her life to the Catholic church as a nun, despite the fact that shes Jewish. Of course, the boy next door (the sadly now retired Michael Schoeffling) gets in the way of her holy ambitions.

But Scorsese and cowriter Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal  to tell a story. And in that its really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best hes ever been, and this is Joe Pescis definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and nonactors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the stars. (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). Goodfellas is (to date) Scorseses last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!",True
"An original, unique, fascinating and intriguing conversation This is the tale of two different men: Andre, an avantgarde director, and Wally, a theatre actor and writer. They meet at a restaurant and philosophise and discuss a variety of subjects. The majority of the dialogue is spoken by Andre. He is a far more loquacious and complex character than Wally. Wally is a laconic and softspoken guy, who enjoys a simple life with his wife. His epitome of bliss is drinking a cold cup of coffee left from the night before, without finding a cockroach in it. Andre is an intense ponderer. He tells Wally the stories of his experiences travelling around the world, from his time spent in far flung places such as Scotland, Poland, India and Tibet. Andre gives the impression he is exaggerating at times. Is he fabricating some of the tales? He could be. Especially the ones where he claims he has seen monsters and weird creatures. The premise of two men conversing for 110 minutes at a dinner table is not going to be the most appealing film, but this film holds your attention and intrigues the viewer. You become involved with Andres musings somehow, and just as fascinated as Wally is. A great piece of arresting cinema.",True
"A beautiful dream with Colin Farrells best screen role ever...It took some time to let Yorgos Lanthimos new film The Lobster  settle into my mind. On the surface is a dark comedy, full of rich  images, and staggering performances from its principal cast. Deeper  lays one of the most original and heart wrenching stories on modern  relationships, likely the best seen in film since Michel Gondrys  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  The Lobster tells the story of a dystopian near future, where single  people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel,  where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty five days  or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods. At the  center is David (played by Colin Farrell), who enters the Hotel with  his brother, whos been turned into a dog, and begins a domino effect  that will make him both an outcast and a fugitive.  Beginning with a hilarious and smart script by Lanthimos and co writer  Efthymis Filippou, The Lobster gets some of the years biggest  laughs. The two create a symphony of truth about our societys  perception of relationships and love. When David first enters the  hotel, you can see the initial despair and fight against the system. He  believes in the idea of love but isnt particularly fond of being under  its spell once again. Its simply life and death but when the story  makes him an outcast, where love is forbidden, you see his hopeless  romantic self become drawn to his Short Sighted Woman. (played by  Rachel Weisz) The evolution of Davids outlook on his current situation  is authentic and real, as he shows the center of his heartache in only  intermittent spurts. You can thank all that to the powerhouse  performance by Colin Farrell, who delivers his best and most audacious  film role to date.  The Lobster isnt just about its script and lead performer. It also  assembles one of the years best cast ensembles. Rachel Weisz is a  sensation, giving her best work since her Oscarwinning role in The  Constant Gardener. As the Lisping Man, its refreshing to see John C.  Reilly dig deep into a role like this, one of which we havent seen  from him in nearly a decade. As the Limping Man, Ben Whishaw  continues to build an arsenal of titaniclike performances, all of  which solidifies him as one of the best kept secrets working today.  More roles for him please. As the Loner Leader, Léa Seydouxs  villainous and vile demeanor is a fantastical addition, adding a needed  depth and danger to the film and role. Olivia Colmans Hotel Manager is  a bonus treat, as she effortlessly brings chuckles and fear to her  mystery woman.  Cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis finds his stride and vision early on,  capturing an aesthetic that is both stylized and advantageous. The  visual contrast is dazzling and particularly noteworthy but whats  lurking between each and every frame is especially dynamic and robust.  One of the years very best. Upon first viewing, Yorgos Mavropsaridis  editing work can seem bloated but over 24 hours later, its a taut and  vivaciously engaging piece, cut with a resemblance of Jeff Buchanan and  Eric Zumbrunnens snubbed work on Spike Jonzes Her. The score is  insanely haunting and very appropriate for its dark natured comic look  at life.  It took some time to digest but The Lobster feels full of life and is  a soulful opus on love. Quirky and clever, its black comic tones  shouldnt distract from its core narrative and mission; to engage the  parimeters and infatuation of devotion. Just a dream.",True
"My favorite movie Without a doubt, my absolute favorite film of all time. I first saw this movie three years ago and I have been in love with it (and Stanley Kubrick) ever since. I never get tired of seeing this movie. Why it remains so underappreciated (at least by casual movie viewers) is beyond me. Everything is great; acting, direction, cinematography, the sets, everything. Something that I dont think anyone else commented on was the Russian motif. The names of the droogs (Alexander, George, Peter, and Dim...short for Dimitri) are decidedly Russian. The singer referenced in the record store, Johnny Zhivago, has obvious Russian overtones. The statement made by the Minister of the Interior about the peaceloving citizens is a direct reference to the name that Soviet government representatives applied to their people when talking about the Cold War. Red seems to stand out from other colors. And, of course, who could forget Nadsat, the Russian slang language? I wonder what Burgess and Kubrick were trying to suggest about the future of Ingsoc (those familiar with 1984 will understand)?",True
"Im Lovin It A competently crafted, steadily paced & extensively researched biographical drama thats further uplifted by Michael Keatons fantastic performance, The Founder covers the rags to riches tale of an ambitious salesman who sensed & tapped the potential of a small fastfood diner in California and turned it into one of the largest & most successful restaurant chains in the world with a bit of hustle, persistence & ruthlessness.Set in the 1950s, The Founder tells the story of Ray Kroc, a travelling salesman who comes across a small diner operated by two Mc Donald brothers in San Bernardino, California and is left dazzled by their lightningfast service, highquality food & strong work ethic. Wanting to be a part of their business, he joins them as their franchising agent to expand the fastfood chain all over America, and ultimately buys the company from the brothers.Directed by John Lee Hancock, The Founder is as much about the cutthroat world of business as it is about the rise of Mc Donalds, and is told in an intuitive manner that keeps the interest alive at all times. Hancock handles the subject matter with restraint, maintains a firm grip over all aspects, and never deviates from the main premise. Also, the momentum is never lost as it moves from the discovery, creation, operation & expansion of Mc Donalds to the ultimate swindling.The old style Mc Donalds restaurants depicted in the film are in tune with the timeline this film is set in and the vast countryside shooting locations help in further evoking its 1950s era. The sharp focus & still handling of camera, in addition to its warm colour palette, helps in providing a homely texture to its images. Editing keeps the pace steady and provides a tight & gripping structure to its plot while Carter Burwells score is ever present in the background and silently performs its duties.Coming to the performances, The Founder features a talented cast in Michael Keaton, John Carroll Lynch, Nick Offerman, Linda Cardellini, Patrick Wilson, B.J. Novak & Laura Dern. Leading from the front is Keaton who delivers another strong performance in whats the second coming of his acting career as he brings Kroc to life with flair, passion & panache. Lynch & Offerman are in as Mc Donald brothers and play their part convincingly, plus the moments between them & Kroc is as amusing as it is riveting.On an overall scale, The Founder is a carefully investigated & smartly scripted biopic thats just as informative as it is entertaining and wonderfully illustrates the rise of the man who dared to dream bigger and singlehandedly turned a small fastfood restaurant into a billiondollar conglomerate with his aggressive business practices. Its also commendable for keeping Krocs personal life out of the main narrative, something most Hollywood biopics are guilty of. A mostly satisfying journey, this story of Mc Donalds made me go Im Lovin It more than once over the course of its runtime, and is definitely worth a shot.",False
"The essence of late 90s cinema  hip, highly stylized, VISUAL Guy Ritchies hip, highly stylized Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a truly remarkable film, not only for its appropriately pyrotechnic camera work, but also for its seemingly flawless, puzzleperfect script/screenplay. While the pictures main focus is on a group of lads who invest money in a highstakes, rigged card game and lose, the broader story concerns approximately eight different groups of criminals whose paths cross (more> than once, in some cases) during various illegal pursuits: money, guns, drugs, even revenge. The film is quite violent, both on and off screen, but its also uniformly humorous throughout. Its important to note that the four central characters (a cook, a card sharp, and a couple of guys who sell discounted items) are interested only in acquiring the money to pay off their enormous debt; they kill no one. The same applies to the laidback college boys who grow copious amounts of ganja. The cast is comprised of mostly young, veteran, male actors. In fact, the only female in the film doesnt even speak, though she handles a machine gun fairly well. Sting appears briefly in several scenes as a barowning father figure. While his secondary performance is solid, as usual, it is also unmemorable. The soundtrack is firstrate, from the 60s hits of James Brown to the contemporary beats of Londons underground. The groovy, pulsating music and lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with the action and dialogue in the film, creating a theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon in cinema (from any period). Critics and audiences over the years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious and unnecessary, stating that it detracts from the story, bogs it down, or pads it; however, the film medium has the luxury of actually displaying a story for its audience, unlike the written word alone. Its what the medium is all about  its VISUAL. Hence, one of the reasons a filmmaker chooses such visual displays is to brand his or her work, in the same way as writers like Cummings, Hemingway or Joyce did with their medium. Its hard to imagine a cinema without Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Scorsese to represent it. To this end, Ritchie has taken his first step in establishing his own brand. His energetic, ultracontemporary camera work incorporates (through a fresh perspective) such devices as slow motion, fast motion, and freezeframe coupled with narration. It is at times reminiscent of (and actually expands upon) Martin Scorseses patented visual stylistics and camera movements, like those found in Mean Streets and Goodfellas. But the similarities with Scorseses work end there. Critics endless comparisons of Ritchies film with the works of Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyles Trainspotting stand mostly unwarranted, as these comparisons take away from the inventiveness and originality of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Ritchies film is a much more involved, complex, layered work than the aforementioned comparisons. While Tarantinos films are very strong on dialogue, screenplay, and editing, they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyles Trainspotting does have a resembling feel to LS&TSB, but aside from its Great Britain origins, there really is no need for comparison. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is essential viewing.",True
"Touching and moving, a great cinematic experience Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No, not a great actor, a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny De Vito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletchers icy stare, Jack Nicholsons smartaleck remarks or Will Sampsons impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldnt change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. Its simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10",True
"Color me bad While the movie states that it is a love story, I think it depends on your definition of love story or how far that term stretches. Let me put it this way: This aint your typical Valentines movie. It is heavy drama and it does depict relationship(s) very harshly. And because it feels so real, you can get sucked into it.The movie got some heat over one scene (rating wise there was some problem in the USA), but if you see it in context, it does make sense. It does hurt, but it makes sense. You should also watch out for the timeline. Though it can be easily followed (hairline), but it might confuse you for a second there. Great movie with great actors!",True
"All the fun of the original with a much better, darker plot The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying its Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion.  While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  its power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I wont spoil it in case youve been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun scifi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at its heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and its simply one of the best of the series to date.",False
"And Dont Forget Scott Joplin!I agree 100 percent that this is a wonderful movie. I first saw it over 30 years ago, and it remains vivid in my mind while I cant remember zip about movies I saw last week which others have praised and I found wanting. I cant think of another film about double and triple crosses that deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence with The Sting (which doesnt mean that some of the others havent been good). In addition to all the things that others have praised, one of the most memorable features of this film is the use of a Scott Joplin rag, which both lends a distinctive period touch and adds a sense of fastpaced motion to the action. Im not much for ranking films  top five, top ten, top 250  but this is one of the best. If you havent already seen it, drop everything and find the DVD. As pure entertainment, it cant be beat.",False

As for violence, there was barely any hardcore violence, certainly not enough to distract from the main storyline. Quite simply, if you loved the music, youll love the movie.

"Transposing geography The geography of film noir is usually a neighborhood, a city, a region ... BRICK transposes this geography onto a high school with surprisingly successful results. Watching it brought to mind not only the black & white films of the 40s and 50s, but glimmers of Gus van Sant, David Lynch and Rivers Edge. What gives BRICK its filmic authenticity (much different from realism) is its language  the language of Chandler and Hammett, but reimagined from the lips of contemporary teens.The effect is staggering. BRICK essentially recreates a world we thought we knew. Suddenly there are forces at work that we recognize because we knew they were there. But to see them in this noir glow is to give them an exciting new life ... to see them again for the first time. There are plot twists and surprises aplenty here, although familiar once you realize the inspirations for the film. But familiarity is more than compensated by a superb cast and (not generally noted in these comments) excellent music. Contemporizing the soundtrack keeps us on our toes and makes a significant contribution to the tension of BRICK.A terrific debut!",True
"Dont Miss This Movie  It Has Everything This is a great, fun, enjoyable movie. It has everything: great lines and killer comebacks, wit, excitement, suspense, drama, charged emotions, great acting, a good story, beautiful cinematography, and of course, the music rocks. It is way, way, way better than the original. let me say that again in caps: IT IS WAY, WAY, WAY BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. I was actually surprised it was so good, given the reviews. I really did not want the movie to end. Afterwards, I found myself wondering what the sisters would be doing 3 years later, and its been a long, long time since Ive cared enough about any movie character to think about them even 5 minutes after the movie. Sparkle delivers on every level: script, cinematography, realism, acting, and singing.On the acting front, Whitney Houston delivered a powerful, raw and completely revealing performance. She was Emma. Her figure, bearing, and presence are completely transformed from legend, Whitney Houston, to a bruised and weary woman who is determined that her babies will not lose their way as she did, and who is fighting with every ounce of her being for their futures. When you know how funny and filled with energy Houston could be, then you see her as this worldweary mother, fighting for her kids, you see how great an acting job she does. She fills the role completely. Her song, His Eye Is On The Sparrow, is the showstopper and anchors the movie perfectly. I cannot think of any singing/song scene in any movie that comes close to what Houston does here. This performance alone is more than worth the price of admission.Mike Epps is another standout as Satin: he delivers a memorable, slick, cool, and lethal performance. All of the sisters are excellent! Tika Sumpter was really great, as was Carmen Ejogo, and though Jordin Sparks character is the quiet sister, she works the role and is believable. There are no weak performances on the screen. And, it goes without saying that the music works perfectly. The three sisters are really smokin hot on the stage, with Carmen Ejogo oozing sensuous sexappeal.Yes, this is a remake, and yes, its a popular theme, but just like fairytales that we enjoy listening to and telling over an over, you want to hear this story retold because it is so well done. There are strong male rolls, and lots of testosteronedriven tensions, and, of course, strong female roles. So, this movie works as a good date night movie, a good movie to see with friends, and as a good movie to see on your own.This is not The Godfather and its not Shakespeare, but it is a well done, enjoyable, emotionally satisfying movie. I highly recommend it. Thumbs way up!",False
"very honorable Familiar but triumphant true story set in the 1950s about a man and his determination to defy the odds. Gooding gives a rock solid performance as an ambitious Navy diver whose iron will leads him to fight discrimination and try to become the first ever colored master diver. Along the way he matches wits with—and eventually gains the respect of—his belligerent, hardnosed superior (De Niro).

"A Triumph Sometimes (even oftentimes) in the world of film criticism, the word triumphant is thrown around. Its often used to describe a film, perhaps more often a performance. Ive certainly used it; its a term I like to pull out when a film seems to go beyond the call of duty. When its more than art, entertainment, or a combination of both. When the story, images, and characters pop off the screen and go with you, and the lasting impression left on you means something more than having killed a couple hours in a big, dark room with a bunch of strangers. Now, after watching 127 Hours, I feel Ive never used triumphant in the correct critical context before.James Francos performance is simply astounding. He, as an actor, is triumphant because his character is, and because he delves into what it means to be bringing this incredible story to life on the big screen for mass consumption. This is a tough role  Franco is basically putting on a oneman show, and he does so elegantly. We feel Aron Ralstons pain because Franco feels his pain and shows it in every line of his face, verbalizes it with every sigh, and lets it control him even as he battles to take control back and find a way out of his dire situation.Its pure, masterful art. Franco is simply flawless. Trapped by the boulder, much of his performance lies in his facial expressions, and he is able to deftly switch from desperation to comedy to a brutal will to survive, all while being barely able to move. Ive rarely been so impressed by an actors work; Franco is wholly deserving of the Oscar.Danny Boyles kinetic, energetic direction is a perfect match for Francos easygoing goofiness, and even when the film becomes grounded in the narrow canyon where Ralston was trapped, Boyle always keeps things interesting. He and cowriter Simon Beaufoy weave flashbacks and hallucinations into Ralstons dilemma to great, heartbreaking effect, and the premonition that drives Ralston to finally dive wholeheartedly into amputating his own arm is breathtaking in its tenderness.Also impressive is Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantles cinematography. Instead of letting the confined space limit their camera techniques, they tackle every possible angle, often bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the action. Shots through the bottom of Ralstons water bottle mark time and heighten the sense of urgency. The addition of home moviestyle footage brings Ralston even closer to the audience; when he expresses his delayed gratitude to his family, youll likely find yourself thinking about the last time you told your parents how much you love them. Its a great device, and is put to best use in one of the films funniest scenes, when Ralston interviews himself Gollumstyle. The combination of the dark humor, varied cinematography, and Francos impressive facial dexterity pitch the scene perfectly; its a lighter moment that is nevertheless grounded in the gravity of the situation.Complementing and combining Chediak and Mantles beautiful shots is Jon Harriss dynamic editing. The use of splitscreen is particularly brilliant, put to use in innovative ways throughout the film: the bookend sequences mark Ralstons departure from and return to society, and the technique in general represents the multiple facets of a seemingly simple tale. Yes, when it comes down to it, 127 Hours is a film about a mountain climber who gets stuck under a boulder and has to cut off his own arm. But its so much more than that. Its about a man overcoming the physical, emotional, and intellectual strains of an unthinkable situation. Its about responsibility, love, and the will to live. Above all, its about the triumph of the human spirit, show more clearly and beautifully here than in any other film I can think of.",True
"Its like a really messed up episode of Kids Say the Darndest Things.I just saw The Hunt at the New Zealand International Film Festival and I walked out speechless. The Hunt has such a difficult story to tell but the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The film doesnt take one side over another, making the point that there isnt really any bad guys in the film, just people on opposite sides of one coin. The script is shocking, tragic and at times funny. The film is very intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film is mostly shot handheld, giving you the feeling of realism. The camera likes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyes that tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was not being said, but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen is stunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays the role with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps you guessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of the innocent young girl to perfection, again always keeping you guessing. Their relationship being one of the most interesting Ive seen on film this year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot ends quite abruptly, not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into the epilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film is without giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers for such a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself, what would I do?",False
"A marvelous character study Amidst all the slambang, Body of Lies is actually a superb character study of two preening, bumbling CIA (presumably) agents trying to save the world in the Middle East. Roger Ferris (Di Caprio) is the agent on the ground, and Ed Hoffman (Crowe) is his remotecontrol boss in Washington. Their collective M.O. is to overreact and improvise at every turn, aided and abetted by their deep attachment to hightech gadgetry and fundamental disregard for human lives. Their ally and foil, the Jordanian head of intelligence (Mark Strong), prefers more patient methods informed by a less skindeep understanding of the people(s) involved.All three are trying to penetrate and take out a shadowy, violent Islamic fundamentalist group and its leader. The plot is serviceable, the elements familiar, but it all works well to coax out Scotts and screenwriter William Monahans critiques of the American way of unconventional war in the Middle East. The movie itself is funny, visually fine (Scotts touch hasnt deserted him), and engaging. Its center is the uneasy but highly entertaining partnership between Di Caprio and Crowe. At times verging on pure comedy (their semiserious macho argument over which of them could beat up the other 10 years ago is a high point), the film never tips too far in this direction thanks to the two actors easy skill and Scotts sure hand at maintaining a certain tone.Is Body of Lies an antiwar statement? I dont think so  its possible Monahan and Scott even think the Americans grotesque imperial venture has a chance, if only they could learn a few lessons from the likes of the selfpossessed Jordanian. But this seems unlikely. At the beginning, Crowe makes the very good point that its precisely the Americans mastery of (by?) their hightech appurtenances that makes it nearly impossible for them to see their foes, who use much more downtoearth techniques  like passing instructions by word of mouth. He then proceeds to ignore his own advice throughout the movie. Di Caprio rips into Crowe for his disregard of the lives of their local operatives, then goes on to thoughtlessly place in mortal danger an architect and an Iranian refugee nurse with whom hes infatuated.They just dont learn. If they did, they wouldnt be who they are: the gallant spreaders of justice, democracy, and casual calamity. If thats what Scott and Monahan are trying to tell us, its antiwar statement enough, the same news that Graham Greene brought us over 50 years ago with The Quiet American, updated and just as pertinent.",True

"A complex, moody film that draws you in on many levels and does not let go Set in China in the 1920s during a cholera epidemic and the nationalist uprising, the film explores the stormy relationship of a dry British doctor and his seemingly incompatible funloving wife. They interact with engaging characters that include French nuns, British expatriates and a Chinese doctor and military officer. The tension is increased by the everpresent threat of death from the epidemic and the political and military unrest that is about to explode. The film is shot with a hazy green look that makes the lush Chinese countryside even more mysterious and beautiful. The film is accompanied by wellchosen music with a particularly gripping main theme by Satie. Norton and Watts do a splendid job in the leading roles.",True
"A sensory delight Based on the recent Marie Antoinette biography by Antonia Fraser, Sofia Coppolas film focuses on the personal qualities of the character of Marie Antoinette and thus participates in the characters historical rehabilitation. Antoinette is seen as a respectful loyal daughter, a loving mother, a patient wife, who had to withstand a flood of vindictive criticism since the moment she set foot in the French court. This depiction contrasts strongly with many prior representations of the character in film (The Affair of the Necklace for example), which show her as superficial, selfish and vain.The visuals and auditory elements, which evoke a powerful image of 18thcentury Versailles, are the movies forte. And their effects linger in ones mind (or at least they did in mine) long after ones exit from the theater. As a budding art historian, I was stunned by the intensely lush visual spectacle the film has to offer: the pomp and circumstance of ritualized and regimented 18thcentury Versailles. The semiprivate world that Antoinette builds for herself to escape Versailless codified, quasitotalitarian atmosphere, is evoked through a sequence of fastmoving images of champagneguzzling, beautifullydecorated cakeeating, and Manolo Blahnik shoe buying. Thus Antoinettes fantasy world is likened to a world recognizable to you, me and Carrie Bradshaw. Some people may scoff at this 21st century world transposed to an earlier time. But as the center of the world in 18thcentury Europe, Marie Antoinettes secret Versailles would certainly have been as hip as this, and Coppola has found effective means through sound and image by which to make this hipness accessible.The story zooms in on the character of Marie Antoinette, played by a ravishing Kirsten Dunst, who arrives at Versailles at the tender age of 14, to become queen of France a mere 5 years later. Coppola emphasizes the loneliness of Antoinette throughout the film: most important is her alienation from the French court by the fact that she is a foreigner (something that made her a scapegoat for all of Frances problems during the 1780s). Her powerlessness to fit in is emphasized also through her sexual alienation from her sociallyawkward husband (played by Jason Schwartzmann), her mothers chidings that she has not yet produced an heir to the French throne (and thereby has not secured Austrias political place in Europe), and the bitchy gossip that goes on behind her back at court.Marie Antoinette is depicted as an intensely personable, friendly and playful person. Coppola fashions a Marie Antoinette who is a dutiful daughter, a patient wife to Louis (who eventually overcomes his shyness and becomes a loving and protective husband and father), and a caring and tender mother. She is shown as both bold and humble, two qualities which had quasimiraculous effects on both the court and the angry mob, as is shown in some of the films most touching moments.Equipped with these essential personal qualities, the charges traditionally made against Marie Antoinette fade completely. It is precisely Antoinettes illfated attempt at fitting into French court society that causes her escape into a world of idle futility and libertinage. Her escape into the world of playing shepherdess in her pleasurehouse of Le Hameau is shown not as a silly escape from responsibility but as the simple human need to be surrounded by the natural world. This place appears to us as it does to Antoinette: as a refuge from the backbiting, totalitarian regime of Versailles. Even the legendary let them eat cake statement allegedly made by Marie Antoinette is discarded as fiction.There is almost no place in the film for the 18thcentury reality as it existed outside the bubblelike world of Versailles. This is not the movies purpose. The end of the film is a bit abrupt: the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere, which again can seem surprising, but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. And it is all to her credit.",True
"The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.When i first saw the trailer of this movie last year, i thought another Spiderman movie?, and again earlier this year seriously, another Spiderman move?. In all honesty, i was not compelled to watch the movie may be it was the trailer or that thought of how far can a Spiderman movie be different than the one produced about a decade ago? How amazing can it be, as its title suggests?After going against the odds, i came out from the movie very pleased. In fact, i enjoyed the move thoroughly and felt very entertained. And i finally understood the word amazing in the title because it is really, pretty amazing!It is not one of those movies with excessive ZOMG factor, for sure. The movie is amazingly captured with great use of CGI. The first half of the movie explores the dark side of Peter Parkers family history in a fairly comical manner. I got to know about Peters father, which was not much explained in the previous trilogy and i dont exactly read the comics.Then there is his high school stories of his love. The next half of the movie was gripping and fastpaced, with well angled shots to make you feel like swinging from building to building and climbing up towers i watched it in 2D and i could still feel the height! This part of the movie focuses on the transformation of Dr Connors as the Lizard, the villain of this movie, who happens to be Peters fathers working partner. His wish to regenerate his arm goes awry, leading him to produce a biological threat that forces Spiderman to a race to save the people in the city.As i said, i was entertained. The movie was light hearted, like watching The Captain America, with brilliant cast. Andrew G performs magnificently as Peter Parker, to a certain extent, i felt him outshine Tobey M. He fits the character well. I enjoyed the scene where he first discovers of his special ability, particularly with the flipping of his skateboard. Much credits to Emma Stone, Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Rhys I, and director Marc Webb for taking the risk of rebooting this franchise. Watch out for Stan Lee in a showstopper scene. Flash, played by Chris, gives me the feeling of a sequel where he will be featured in a bigger role like Jacob in Twilight.Give this Spiderman a try. For a twohour movie, this movie does not fall short and does not feel long. And a sequel is pretty likely stay for the postcredit (duh! almost all Marvel movies has this).I have to say this one more time: The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.",False
"There is no Murder in Paradise The Ukranian orphan Leo is raised by a Russian family and becomes national hero during the World War II. In the 50s, Captain Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy), his best friend Alexei Andreyev (Fares Fares) and the coward Vasili Nikitin (Joel Kinnaman) join the Ministry of State Security (MGB) during the political regime of Stalin and Leo marries Raisa Demidov (Noomi Rapace). When Alexeis son is found murdered completely naked near the railway, the official explanation is that the boy was hit by a train since there is no murder in paradise since it is a capitalist disease. But Leo finds other similar cases and proceeds investigating, falling in disgrace with the Party. He loses his rank and is transferred with Raisa to Volsk to work with General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman). When a body of another boy is found near the railway in the same conditions of Alexeis son, Leo convinces Nesterov that there is a serialkiller and he agrees that Leo conducts a further investigation. Meanwhile the ambitious Vasili tries to persuade Raisa to leave Leo and move to Moscow to stay with him. What will happen to Leo and Raisa?Child 44 is a film with a promising storyline, great performances but not engaging. The political subplot is weird and raises the doubt whether it is true the premise that there is no murder in paradise or it is an antisoviet propaganda as mentioned in the previous review. In a controlled political society by a dictatorship, it is expected low crime rates as consequence. But why not secretly investigate a serialkiller? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Crimes Ocultos (Hidden Crimes)",False
"Its not that bad...a comment on the times.....A few comments here have slammed this movie for being shallow, despite decent performers. Maybe this is not 100% similar to real life. But it does have some parallels, and except for the Judd Neldon character (rather annoying) it is realistic and comedic in some aspects.Demi Moore as Jules is simply lost in denial borrowing money to keep up an image of success. They are 26 years old and have no clue what is in store. Andrew Mc Carthy likable and sympathetic. Ally Sheedy, just okay. Rob Lowe is very good as irresponsible Billy, involved with Mare Winningham, the resident unattractive old standby girlfriend.There are some scenes reminiscent of a frat party. A few scenes with Emilio Estevez, pursuing a pipedream romance with Andie Mc Dowell. Basically it addresses recent graduates floundering, attempting different careers and lifestyles, affairs and obsessions. It catches that time period most of us had, when we thought we were so significant in the world, not yet jaded, still trying to find meaning and hope. The Winningham character particularly conveys the aspect of the screenplay. When her father (Martin Balsam) tells her to just get married settle down and have a greeting card franchise (like the rest of her family) No I am committed to my real job, she says as she works as a social worker, still trying to have an affect.Similar to the later Generation X issues, and the now sense of alienation, everyone goes through similar growing pains, whether 80s materialism, 90s nihilism (Reality Bites) or todays general alienation and violence. The issues are the same, the culture just manifests them a bit differently. 8/10",False
"War  Dogs Director Todd Phillips, mostly famous for The Hangover trilogy, decided to make a military/economic thriller. It sounds as quite a radical change, but after a few seconds, its clear that War Dogs will employ the absurd and surrealistic humor Phillips is accustomed to work with. The only difference is that War Dogs is based on true events... something which makes it more cynical and disturbing. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill make an excellent work as traders with temperaments which are very different, but well balanced in order to flourish in the unpredictable world of guns trafficking. War Dogs isnt strictly a comedy. There are wide doses of humor, but beneath the laughs, there is a serious antiwar manifest which doesnt only aim at denouncing war in itself, but also the huge political and economic apparatus feeding from the conflict... ie, the death and suffering of uncountable innocents. That isnt a message traditionally expressed with lightness, but coscreenwriters Phillips, Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic make it work in both the didactic and recreational levels. War Dogs undoubtedly belongs to Teller and Hill, but the supporting cast also makes a perfect work in their roles, highlighting Ana de Armas and the great Kevin Pollak. Some people are comparing War Dogs to The Wolf of Wall Street, but I found it more similar to The Big Short, which examined the economic collapse of Wall Street. Both were made by directors specialized in comedies, and despite dealing with serious themes, their executions employed humor in order to make the hard truths they revealed more accessible. I would consider War Dogs a bit inferior to The Big Short, but it still deserves an enthusiastic recommendation as a fascinating film which leaves us thinking for a long while after we leave the cinema. Each person will know if they stay thinking How is it possible for things like that to happen? or How can I get into that business?.",True

"a quiet little gem.Man, Im a sucker for this kind of picture. Realism. A movie about real people, in real situations, just like you and me. No frills, no fantasy, no flash. Its not that I dont like movies with these elements in them; Its that a prefer movies without them. I like Michelle Williams without the makeup  just a waif caught in a tough situation in a generic Americana setting. It looks like a small town, but I see the credits say its Portland Oregon.Im also a sucker for trains, so I loved all the train shots. Is there a symbolism to the trains? Funny how many times a forlorn train horn is heard nearby, punctuating the quiet desperation of Wendys plight. I loved the security guy (Wally Dalton)  he shows us theres hope no matter what the situation.....there really is always someone who cares. I sure hope Wendy makes it to Alaska; she deserves to.For those who like this one, youll like a similar movie I viewed just a few days previous; it has a similar pace, and feel as this one, and a storyline with a little more tension: Frozen River. Catch it if you can.",True
"A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Waynes past. Christopher Nolans conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolans approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and thats its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batmans archnemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two Face works best as Batmans most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batmans most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in BATMAN & ROBIN. Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledgers posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledgers performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.**** (out of four)",True
"Superb three character thriller Despite the fact that this film looks like it has been shot with a 500 dollar budget it is very worth while. Of course Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke are somewhat famous actors, but they are not necessarily famous for their great acting skills. Yet in this cheap production, that has no tricks whatsoever to distract you from bad performances both are able to stand tall, as is Rovert Sean Leonard. Sure the film takes a bit getting used to, especially in the beginning when the actors have almost nothing to work with, but in the end the actors are what carries the film and they do so in a grandiose fashion.  Some part of the credit has to go to the great dialog as well though, since the words that are spoken are able to grab you by the throat and keep you interested in figuring out what truth lies behind the talk. Nothing Linklater did was too spectacular, so I am sure any director could have pulled this one, but since Linklater was the one I must give him credit (and the rest of the cast and crew) for making such a good film.

"Nothing short of astounding This was the best movie I have seen in a very in a very long time and immediately jumps into my favorite movies ever. MOON puts a relatable human touch on an intriguing and deep scifi story that, while it originally appears to be taking the path of 2001 Space Odyssey, is a unique adventure. Sam Rockwell puts on a spellbinding performance and Kevin Spaceys GERTY voiceover is eery and excellent. I have never seen a movie that had me so engrossed and intrigued from beginning to end. Some may say the film starts slowly but I found the first half hour to be an important and gripping portrayal of what it would mean to be alone in space, without which the movie would not be as effective. I dont want to ruin the plot so I wont go into further detail. As an avid movie watcher who is not a scifi buff I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a movie that will take over their lives for 2 hours and have you leave the theater wanting to do nothing but discuss how beautifully layered it was.",True
"A Powerful Spectacle I didnt find it to be a mess at all, and it was certainly the best thing the Wachowskis have ever done. Im not sure how the directing duties were distributed, so Ill uniformly praise Tom Tykwer as well.I havent read the book, so I cant make any comparisons there, but I dont often leave a film adaptation wanting to read the novel afterwards, as I did after seeing this.Visually stunning, epic in scope, a strong score; the sort of film that youre constantly amazed was ever made and happy it was. Equal parts comedy, romance, thriller, and dystopian speculative fiction, it really is an astounding mix of disparate elements. The biggest overall failure was definitely some of the makeup effects  trying to turn Doona Bae into a believable redheaded Caucasian woman was simply distracting  but the overall art & sound design was incredible.If I could turn channels while watching TV and switch between stories and narratives as seamlessly and as deftly as the editing in Cloud Atlas, it would honestly be hard to go back to simply watching one show at a time.Truly a marvel of multitasking on so many levels.

"Good script, good acting equals good film.Jerry Maguire has to rate as one of the most quotable movies of the last decade and a half. Its given us the lines Show me the money, Help me, Help you, You had me at hello and You complete me. And its that last line, that really describe this movie. Its really about the growth of an individual. We see Jerry Maguire the character, grow from just an agent to becoming much more, its not an easy trip but for the most part its an entertaining one. Jerry Maguire is a top sport agent. He has a decent amount of big names as client and hes engage to a beautiful woman. Then one day while visiting one of his client in the hospital, the clients young son confronted him after he gives the client a shallow encouragement. The confrontation stick in his mind and would even get him to write a mission statement for the company. The mission statement basically lays out a plan that the agents give their clients more personal attention. Unfortunately his boss doesnt like it. The movie gives us a look at the world of the sports agents. Who are they that gets a cut of an athletes earning and do they really deserve it? In the beginning theyre just there to negotiate the numbers and get the athletes as much exposure. In the end, Jerry has become more than a guy who makes deal for an athlete. It also gives us a look at some clients theyre more demanding than the agents are prepared to handle. But if handled right they will prove to be worth the trouble.Jerry Maguire is played by Tom Cruise, and he gives one of his best performance. I think its every bit the equal of Cuba Gooding Jrs. Oscar winning performance. Both men were on top of their game playing off each other. Its sad that his erratic behavior of late has caused harmed to his career because Tom Cruise is a very good actor. So too is Mr. Gooding and Renee Zellwegger, who plays an office worker in Tom Cruises office and who joined him as he tries to put forth his mission statement into practice. All in all, I think its a good movie with a very observant script, complimented by great acting.",True
"Almost too painful to watch  and thats a good thing If you ever thought a womans right to choose was an easy one, this will take care of that. Unexpected pregnancy can be from carelessness of course, but it can also be from fallible birth control, boyfriends who lie, and people you were with against your will. This is three distinct movies in one on the same topic of a woman trying to chose to have, or not have, an unexpected baby. Each one is set in a different decade.
I had to turn the volume down and close my eyes at times. Not for gruesomeness but the way you close your eyes when someone is about to hit that awful note in the Star Spangled Banner. You feel the pain of their attempt at something difficult. You dont just watch this movie, you feel it.Men are not portrayed as multidimentional as the women are, but they are not the villian either. They are included yet they can never fully understand.  You see the suffering the women go through in their own head, how difficult it is, the wavering in their decisions. They have equal fear of having an abortion, having a baby, and having the people around them know of their predicament.",False
"Cocaine, They Started that.  Your Welcome.That statement was said by Denis Leary who, not surprisingly, coproduced this drug epic with Ted Demme who not only directs this film, but Learys special No Cure for Cancer. Watching that special, I wouldve never expected a movie this good and serious, but it is. And unless a better film comes along this year, Blow might just be the best film of 2001.In this biopic, George Jung is a guy who starts out by selling pot in the California area. After a while though, he progresses to selling cocaine in the late 70s and early 80s with the infamous Pablo Ecobar, and becomes a multimillionaire (Jung, played by Jonny Depp very well, explains that if you bought cocaine in that time period in America, there would be a 85 percent chance it was from him). But then we see how things change with time, especially with Jung, which makes this movie even more fascinating and excellent.While Blow is stylish, smart and hard edged with good stuff, the film also has compassion and feeling, inparticular in the third act which gives this movie a clever turn. Also with brilliant acting from the cast (the ensemble includes Depp, Paul Ruebens, Penelope Cruz and in a twist of a role from Good Fellas, Ray Liotta as Jungs dad) and a well told story, this is one of the best biopics and drug movies of the 00s.",False
"Alejandro is the Real Deal This movie really touch my soul in very different ways, I was laughing and crying at the same time when I was watching it. Alejandros clean smooth directing really states a new canon in the way a movie is conducted, I was blown away with Michael Keatons perfect performance and the rest of the cast did well around him. I had never seen this kind of genre called Magical realism as well as in this movie, it really submerge you inside the head of the main character and the brilliant drumbased score helps to explain the situation by the minute. I am very happy with the Oscars won by Alejandro (well deserved) especially because I am Mexican too. I know that this kind of movie is not for everyone, some people said that it is boring, pretentious, overthe top, strange, difficult to understand, hideous. But let me tell you this movie is fascinating, touching, funny, sad, eloquent, fantastic and dramatic.

"Its no There Will Be Blood To watch actors dryly deliver page after page of plot that no one comprehends or is interested in while they imitate the acting style of old Hollywood noir films and stoner comedies is not why I go to the movies. Paul Thomas Anderson is a great filmmaker when he uses his own voice, and thankfully this film is the only exception to that.Unless youre a superhuman, you wont have the memory (or attention span) to understand the plot. Its as if its deliberately convoluted, like Anderson doesnt want us to know whats going on, or at least doesnt want us to care. Yet this is not the case because of the scenes that dwell on nothing else but dialogue whose only purpose is to read plot to us and maybe put us to sleep. There isnt any character beyond caricature. I dont relate to this Doc character beyond the his relationship with his exgirlfriend which is the only thing that one can possibly invest emotion into, albeit this is not an emotionally driven story. The characters are supposed to be funny but I just found them bizarre. That being said, there is something about the overall tone and production design of the film that sticks. The meandering nature of the era is there and while weve seen many similar films about the 70s this film is just different. Its ambitious in the way that its so plain but also strange, only many will have a hard time deciphering between art and bullshit. Its bullshit to me because there wasnt anything for me to take from the film. It was more this is kind of weird but to no end.I would not recommend this film to anyone unless you are a cinephile, in which case you just have to see it because its Paul Thomas Anderson. I feel bad for anyone who naively walks into this film looking for something to enjoy and laugh at. Parts got laughs but they were widely dispersed in a film that just felt like it wouldnt end. Being the fan of Andersons that I am I feel like this film was a waste of time. Even if you end up liking it (which I personally would not understand) youll see what I mean.",True
"Metal, Loss, Arson, and Moving On Simply put, Hesher is an exploration of loss: a universal experience shared by the films characters: a nihilistic headbanging arsonist named Hesher (Joseph Gordon Levitt), a supermarket clerk with thickrimmed eyeglasses and financial troubles named Nicole (Natalie Portman) who doesnt like being called lady, a depressed widower named Paul (Rainn Wilson) who takes pills and sleeps all day, and a boy named T.J (Devin Brochu) who recently lost his mother, has a crush on an older woman, and is constantly bullied at school.There are equal moments of humor and sorrow that bring a unique balance to the film. The best way I can talk about a film is by talking about the particular moments that stood out and made it such a beautiful picture. There is a particular scene where TJ and Paul go to a self help group to help cope with their loss that is one of the most brutally realistic and painful, yet beautiful scenes I have seen on film. Seeing these people talk about their grief was like watching real people as opposed to actors. That is how good the performances are.Aside from wellexecuted emotiondrenching scenes such as that one, there are also real subtle touches in the dialogue between the characters that I rarely see in other films. There is a tender scene where Nicole saves T.J. from a bully. After offering him a ride home, she confesses that the reason she helped was because she didnt want to turn on the news that night and see that a young boy was beaten to death in a parking lot. She really did it for herself so she wouldnt feel guilty later and she apologizes for being selfish like that. The irony here being that that the fact she would feel guilty about something like that makes her a good person and someone who really wants to help.There is great acting from all involved, particularly Levitt, Wilson, and Brochu. Levitts actor shows hardly any emotion but there is a particular scene involving a close up where you can gradually see his eyes water as his heart breaks. Wilson continues to impress. He was great in Super and was amazingly real here as well. His heartache and apathy is devastating to watch and shows you how much pain he is in. But the best performance comes from Devin Brochu. He is amazingly good for someone that young. To be able to incorporate a character so completely and fearlessly is amazing to watch. The audience feels for this young boy and you wish someone would just come in and help him. The world is very dangerous for a child and you root for T.J. and hope he overcomes all the troubles he faces.All in all, Hesher is a great film that is at the same time both hilarious and moving.P.S.

Must see Thought provoking and heartbreaking look back at the dark days of the early terror of HIV. It pulls no punches in showing that AIDS was largely ignored as long as it was primarily in the Gay community (should be to our shame). Makes you wonder how far we might have gone in the research and containment of this disease had we gotten behind ending it from the start. Lots of lip service from those who had the power to actually help but little action whereas in the Gay community shown in this film...the average person came up to the bat and fought with everything they had to save those they loved.

"Decent (and not raunchy) spin on Rrated comingofage comedy Before you ever see the first shot of Youth in Revolt, you know whats going on. A repetitive motion sound is heard as well as the flipping of pages. Nick Twisp (Cera) is masturbating and almost everyone in the theater knows it. Now thats testament to how far the Rrated comedy sexual revolution has come over the last decade, so its not surprising to see a film so unabashed about teenage sex let alone one whose entire plot is driven by a teenagers zealous appetite to shed his virginity.The always softspoken and awkwardly verbose Cera plays yet another character that fits his mold in Twisp, a teenager with divorced parents who loves Fellini films and vintage vinyl and really, really wants to get laid. Its a semiromantic aspiration as well, but the depths to which hell let his hormones take him is at times even implausibly absurd. On vacation with his mother (Jean Smart) and her lover Jerry (Zach Galifianakis of The Hangover), Nick meets a perfect match in the daughter of two devout Christian trailer park folks named Sheeni Saunders and the two have an awkward but adorable summer fling. Newcomer Portia Doubleday makes an impression in this early portion of the film as Sheeni, teasing Nick and viewers with her poise and charm. When Nick has to go, he realizes their relationship (and his ascent to manhood) is at risk. He devises a scheme to get his father to move to Sheenis town and his mother to get mad enough to send him to live there. The only problem, is that for it to work, sweet and innocent Nicky will have to be bad.Nick invents an alternate persona for himself, one based on Sheenis ideal man. Hes a blue eyed mustached, chainsmoking Frenchman named Francois Dillinger and hes Nick without hesitation or reservation. Cera does wisely in agreeing to be in this film because of this alter ego aspect. Having to be Francois pushes Cera out of that same old wimpy character box and has him being frank  and really dirty  for once. If Cera doesnt want to flame out in the near future, hell need more parts like this.From here on out, Youth in Revolt sort of tumbles into a teenage daydream of all the insane things any good, normal kid would do for love and sex  if it were all fiction. The creation of Francois doesnt exactly justify the ridiculous decisions Nick makes like burning down half of Berkeley, California, for example. Its fun, but not all that memorable. Ive never read the C.D. Payne novel, but you can tell it was much more extensive and that Gustin Nash had a hard time with the adaptation. All the events feel compressed, especially in the middle and last acts. Nothing builds gradually, it just gets stuck in. Some characters such as Sheenis drugendorsing older brother (Justin Long) whos snuck in toward the end, feel important to the story in an intangible way, but dont leave any particular impression. Nashs adaptation, despite having the comedic dialog down, lacks a clear interpretation of Paynes story by which to tailor itself. In other words, deciding on one of the books messages to craft the adaptation around mightve helped eliminate certain parts of the story and alleviate the cramming. Director Miguel Arteta picks up on some subtler ideas such as how the many side characters act as insight on or inspire rebellious behavior, but they mostly get lost in the love story and Nicks sexual comingofage.Youth In Revolt is an explicit teenage Rated R comedy, but not a raunchy one, which ultimately makes it more respectable than more than half the genre offthebat. Much respect to The Weinstein Co. and Dimension Films for not trying to taper back for a PG13 considering R closes the film off to half its intended audience. At the same time, its not as unique or genrechanging as Aretas indie stylings try and make it out to be. Once again, audiences have grown accustomed to an assortment of male genital references and open discussion about sex. But there are some good performances from young actors and clever dialog in Youth in Revolt and it deserves a viewing.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com",False
"Detractors of this film were fooled by the trailer.American Gangster has been really hated upon in many of the former posts I have read. Yet it seems like they are all saying the same thing, that Gangster didnt have enough action and was really drawn out. Anyone who has every seen a Ridley Scott film will know that his films are long! Blade Runner, A Good Year, Matchstick Men, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, G.I. Jane, Thelma and Louis, and Alien all ran for at least two hours or more, so big surprise there guys. In addition Scott didnt set out to film another scarface, he set out to tell a story not just about Frank Lucas but rather a tale of corruption and how pervasive it is. One user commented that this film had many side story lines that bloated the story. This is completely untrue as every side story is actually the overarching story about the fight against corruption in every facet of life, even Frank Lucas attempts several times to eradicate the corruption in his organization.Over all this is a great film which really gets into every nook and cranny of an issue. Dont see this film if your just looking for cheap thrills, this is a thinking film about the pervasive dishonesty of our culture.I gave this film 8 stars because i could find nothing solid that detracted from it, but rather a slew of minor details which gradually brought its score down. But I will put this film in my top films for the year, if only because I have been immensely unsatisfied with the bulk of releases this year.",True

However, its not the acting that makes this movie terrible, the acting is fine. Its the story line, or lack thereof, that makes this movie a real dud. What was the point? Three loosely connected stories featuring women with mundane lives. There is no sound track, the cinematography is bleak and mediocre, the character development is practically nonexistent and the ending leaves you flat and empty feeling. It truly was a waste of $12 and 2 hours of my time. With the myriad of movies to choose from, do yourself a favor and pick something else.",False
"Why is this movie titled Paterno???And before anyone attempts to call my review a Penn St faithful or Aterno faithful or anything like it... Im a Buckeye. Lifelong, die hard Buckeye. So I owe nothing to the Nittany Lions. But Ive got to be honest... this movie literally has nothing to do with Joe Pa. This movie shouldve been titled Sandusky and Pacino could have honestly been left out of this film entirely. Save a heavy hitter like him for a real movie about this man. They really wasted Pacino. And it was honestly a pretty ridiculous plot line. They attempted to pin Sanduskys cover up and scandal on Joe, but also attempting to paint him as basically senile or something. Like he seems completely out of it for anything at all besides football. So if that how you feel, then why are you trying to blame him for what Sandusky did? ESPECIALLY considering that the moment Joe heard about it he told the AD exactly what he knew? If Joe is so spaced out and such, why are you attempting to blame him and not the fully of sound mind AD???I dont get this film at all. It seems like they are just trying to capitalize on a big name and big scandal and not actually make a credible or even entertaining film.",False
"A surface exploration chronicling what most of us fans already know/assume Boom! We go to set, I get my 70s Chevelle, Matthew Mc Conaughey says, recalling his experience on the set of Richard Linklaters film Dazed and Confused in 21 Years: Richard Linklater. Its gonna be my first scene in the movie, and Im going, F***, here we go!, and Im really nervous, he continues. Im going, Who am I? What am I about? Whats my man, whats my man?, and I remember in my head hearing Woodersons voice going: All right, Im about pot, rock n roll, my car, and p****. Well, Im high, Im in my Chevelle, Im listening to Nugent, and I heard action. And I got all of those things but one, he finishes.Such moments of reflection and analysis on the career of Linklater are prominent in 21 Years: Richard Linklater, an unapologetic loveletter to the director from a large group of people who have worked with him since his beginning. At seventyfive minutes, the film plays more like a bonus feature on a Linklater DVD set, or a welcomed addition at a wrapparty for the director, rather than a standalone documentary feature. Unlike Mike Myers film Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon, where the documentary concerns a subject and is fueled with just as much energy and charisma as its subject, 21 Years is more about congratulatory analysis over some sort of stylistic structure. With this particular documentary being robbed of that key feature, we get a film more centered on complementary analysis and bulletpointed observations than anything of thoughtprovoking substance.The documentary isnt a total loss, though. Its an interesting analysis of some of Linklaters more perplexing directorial choices, such as The Bad News Bears and A Scanner Darkly within two years of one another, and the impact and production process of the Before trilogy. Interviewees such as Jack Black, Joey Lauren Adams, Billy Bob Thornton, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delphy all elaborate on the experience they had working with the man himself and demystify his process, affirming my assumption through interviews and assumptions of the man that his style is lax and largely up to the capabilities and the willingness of the audience. It is true, in fact, that Linklater leaves a lot of the naturalism and possibilities of his films up to the improvisation skills of his actors, while in other cases, making scenes heavily scripted so the actors can follow them to a tee.The actors all give their impressions of working with Linklater, in addition to chronicling the impact his films have had. Filmmakers like Kevin Smith and the Duplass brothers, Jay and Mark, discuss the farreaching and groundbreaking effects Linklaters official directorial debut Slacker had on the independent cinema movement of the 1990s. Rather than scapegoating or giving an elaborate list of excuses as to why he was prohibited or limited in making a film the way he wanted, Linklater silently told all of the innerfilmmakers in us just do it, no excuses. People like Smith saw his film Slacker and were motivated to turn the cameras on their neighborhoods and give them a breath of cinematic life. With the rise in technology and the ubiquity of cameras, editing software, and a means to release ones creation, Linklater effectively established a policy built on no excuses  just the pursuit of filmmaking.21 Years: Richard Linklater, throughout all its congratulating and hailing of its titular subject, leaves out perhaps Linklaters most important contribution to the arts, which was restoring Austin, Texass arts and entertainment field by developing a film festival for independent talent following a huge monetary cut in the funding of the arts for the town. Linklaters philanthropy is left for the tailend of the documentary, given a pamphlets worth of exposition while the entire bout of end credits are devoted to thanking Linklater for all he has done for them. Linklater, himself, is sadly absent to his own party, either for reasons attributed to being reclusive or hed prefer his films lacking in direct interpretation from the source (the latter is likely the case, judging by the often cryptic quotes from him that punctuate each chapter in this documentary). 21 Years, due to its length and the positivity of its content, is hardly a task to watch, but its surface exploration and congratulatory aura ultimately provide for frustration, especially for fans who likely know a great deal of this information already and didnt need common knowledge treated as groundbreaking revelations by the people grateful enough to get an up close look at the man.Directed by: Matthew Dunaway and Tara Wood.",False
"Real American Beauty  an exceptional movie Ive never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I wont speak to story here as its covered in the other comments.This is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.The feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat  but I consider it a true rarity. It didnt feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash  but Im not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I cant say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, its making me sound like a hippie, for heavens sake. This for me was Penns best work since Indian Runner.What it reminded me of...Terence Malik  Herzog?  in a strange way Cassavettes?  Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold & Maude...)  even a bit of Ken Loach Ruby in Paradise  Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore  Five Easy Pieces  Easy Rider... but when I list those its not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films)  its again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was too long but I dont agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.Hal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places  he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedders music worked perfectly as well  not distracting or quirky  just a part of the whole.The film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic.",True
"A funny but uneven work about a character than can be irritating It feels as if were back in Greenburg territory with While Were Young made four years later, since we have the same writer and director (Noah Baumbach) and the same lead actor (Ben Stiller) playing a similar central character. This time, Stiller is Josh, married to Cornelia (Naomi Watts), a middleaged married couple who find themselves hooking up with Jamie (Adam Driver) and Darby (Amanda Seyfried), a couple in their twenties, who remind the older pair of the freshness and spontaneity of youth while he struggles professionally and she laments their inability to become parents.The female roles are underwritten and, while Driver is good, this is really Stillers film. The trouble is that he is such an irritating character, unable to complete a longrunning project to produce a boring documentary and foolishly trying to recapture his lost youth. There are some funny scenes and situations, but this is an uneven work with a sequence at a hippy retreat proving particularly silly.",True
30 years ago...I am shocked to realise this hilarious film is now 30 years old! Films from 1964 seen in 1988 looked a zillion years apart.....how can a 1980s film like this one still be so new and play so fresh in 2014? ...Apart from it being funnier and truly inspired I really now appreciate more the legacy of John Hughes in his series of films that were released in that 5 year span 198489. Anthony Michael Hall is rightly celebrated and gorgeous Molly Ringwald deserves her fame in the teen hall of Stardom. Whatever happened to Michael Schoeffling (Jake)....anyone know? It seems incongruous that so many future stars got their start in this film yet he seemed to go nowhere. I am also very surprised it got a PG rating.......given the swearing and the nudity..but I guess in the spirit of it all it was a perfect pic for anyone 12  112. Very clever and very funny.,False
"A Bold And Epic Exercise Terence Malicks existential and experimental drama is truly something special. When I first started watching the film, I was trying to figure out what Malick was aiming to portray due to the films somewhat convoluted structure, but towards the end, I took in every aspect of the film, the themes of family, of existence, of life in general. Many see this as a hitandmiss film, but unless you truly focus your attention, youll miss the point its trying to make. Is it pretentious? Indeed, but its equally an amazing picture.We sit for 2 hours and follow Jack, a young child growing up in a dysfunctional house with Brad Pitt playing (extremely well) his strict and overwhelming father in the 1950s. The story feels inspired by the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and the arthouse feel of Von Trier, but despite this, The Tree of Life has its own unique and bold style that works well in creating a haunting and emotional visual treat, accompanied with fantastic performances from Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain and stunning cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki. The Tree of Life is a bold and epic exercise from Malick that acts as a commentary on our society, a truly rewarding view.",True

"The Hero of the Hudson River On January 15th 2009, after a bird strike with the loss of two turbines, Captain Chesley Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and First Officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) land an Airbus A320 with 155 passengers on the Hudson River saving their lives. Sully is claimed a hero by the press and public; however the official investigation reports that one of the left engines was running at idle and not damaged. And the flight simulator indicates that it would be possible to land at La Guardia or Teterboro. Sully has to defend himself to the commission; otherwise Sully has to defend his reputation and career showing new evidences of the incident.

"A powerful film showcasing two of Frances greatest actors Amour (2012) is a French film written and directed by Michael Haneke.This powerful drama is basically a twoperson film. Emmanuelle Riva plays Anne, a retired piano teacher, and Jean Louis Trintignant is Georges, her husband. This elderly couple are still healthy, independent, and financially secure. When one of them becomes sick, it sets off a chain of events that is grim, realistic, and disturbing for us to watch. The film is basically a twocharacter tour de force. Riva and Trintignant are on the screen in almost every scene. Other characters enter and leave the apartment from time to time, but the movie revolves around the two leads. Both of them act so well that after a while you forget theyre acting.Incidentally, Isabelle Huppert, in a supporting role, plays Eva, their grown daughter. Shes also a fine actor, but the film belongs to Riva and Trintignant.We left the theater with the realization that we had witnessed a truly great film. However, I have to admit that we were shaken by the harsh and sad reality that was portrayed.So, if you admire great cinema, this is the movie for you. If youre looking for a lighthearted romp about aging, choose a different film.P.S. Amour actually starts in media res. Its important to see the precredit beginning of the movie.

"Tedious exercise in dysfunction First I should say, this movie could have been about my town and my family. I grew up in Connecticut and was 11 years old when the ice storm hit. My family was probably the typical dysfunctional unit of the 70s – emotionally clueless, parents headed for divorce (though we didnt know that yet), so I should have been able to relate to this film.The problem with the movie is theres no humor, no humanity. Its just one dysfunctional, sad, deviant event after another. Its like someone from another planet was assigned a homework exercise to depict dysfunctional families on Earth. I couldnt relate to the characters and there was no one to like.Ill give it 4 stars for the nice cinematography, the allstar cast, the good period sets and clothes.

"Terrific Entertainment From the Master With everything you expect from Hitchcock and more, North By Northwest is terrific entertainment from the master.  There are interesting characters, an exciting story with intrigue and suspense, lots of fine photography, and some of Hitchcocks bestknown set pieces.  Its capped off by a fine Bernard Herrmann score that is almost as good as the one he wrote later for Psycho.Cary Grant may be the ideal Hitchcock actor, and he is a big part of making this such great fun.  As one of the manontherun characters that Hitchcock loved to make movies about, Grant is entertaining and believable, maintaining good humor even as he tries to work his way out of a series of desperate situations.  The other stars, James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, also are very good, and the supporting roles are all filled by good character actors.The story is one of Hitchcocks most exciting.  Its slightly longer than usual, and it occasionally stretches credibility, but it all goes by quickly because there is always something interesting going on, and there is also plenty to look at.  Whether using the famous landmarks or using more everyday settings, there is always lots of good detail, and the settings complement the story nicely.  At times the plot becomes somewhat fanciful, but probably deliberately so, for it only emphasizes Hitchcocks mastery of technique that he can have his characters do almost anything and make you believe it at the time.With everything that characterizes Hitchcock at his very best, this fully deserves its reputation as one of the finest films by him or any other director.  You can watch it several times and still find it just as entertaining.",True
"brilliant screwball comedy This type of movie has simply not been done for 40 or 50 years. Comedy based upon timing, script, and coincidence (the screwball part) is very rare.Unlike todays comedy, based on the outrageous, the actors in this genre have to know how to deliver the lines, keep the pace. The resurrection of a genre.One of the unusual parts of this film worth noting is the score. The music moves the action a great deal of the time. And the composer kept the sound from the era almost flawlessly: big band jazz of the late 1930s. (there are a couple of slips into later jazz styles, very minor  musicologists may be annoyed  but no one else will notice) The music becomes one of the characters of the plot, interacting almost as much as the actors do. That alone is a brilliant device, tried by many, mastered rarely, especially in period.Amy Adams and Frances Mc Dormand have a wonderful interplay, both sides of the romantic slide: young, desired, older, having past love by.great movie if you like your comedy a little faster, but with no one whos eating anything disgusting for a laugh.",False
"Painful, Yet Moving True Story....Definetly one of the most inspiring movies ever made. 
As individuals, it would be quite easy to feel helpless while up against a disease such as ALD and a medical establishment that has agendas other than the life of a small child.  But Augusto and Michaela Odone refused to just stand idly by and while there sons life slipped away from them.  Instead, they made the unprecedented decision to learn as much as they could about their sons devastating illness and then set about to find a cure.  Because of their efforts, thousands of boys will now be able to enjoy a life their child will not.  Had they not been the exceptionally educated and intelligent people that they were I dont know if they would have been able to accomplish such an unbelievable feat.  Who knows?  Whats important to remember, and what I think is the moral of the story is that great things can be accomplished when people become determined to make a difference.
Though Lorenzo regained his sight, some motor skills, and the ability to swallow, his condition hasnt improved to a large degree over the years, and will not until science is able to regenerate the myelin sheath covering his brain that was all but destroyed by the ALD.  At the end of the movie, Augusto was involved with a group of scientists who were about to begin trials that would put the myelin back into some puppies who were born with this defect.  I, along with others pray for those suffering from this disorder, as well as for people with other diseases such as Multiple Schlerosis that this therapy could help, that they will be successful.      
Sadly, Michaela passed away not too long ago.  Being from Virginia the Odones are considered heros in this state, so her death made the papers here.  I cried when I thought of how difficult it must have been for her to have to leave the child shed spent so many years giving hours upon hours of endless care and attention.  Im sure it never crossed her mind that he would outlive her.  If youve never seen this movie, be sure not to miss it.  Its a stellar 10!!

"Either you love it or you get nothing from it.Im not a professional in film reviews, to begin with. Im just an University student whos got an enormous passion for cinema. It was years since a movie moved my soul in such a profound way. I was stunned when I saw that the movie summed up a 7.5 rating here on IM Db. I thought about this fact for some days, then I kind of make up my answer. Youth is the symbol of many struggles in cinema and in peoples mind. American movies and many Europeans ones as well are so easy to like, just because theyre easy to follow. They show facts, actions, somehow explained by words and some ideas. Ideas are like the salt we put on on our meals to make them tasty. Films like Youth are the exact opposite: words and ideas are the meal, and a few actions are the salt. Actually all the actions are at the end of the movie, they could be perceived as a climax, but theyre more like the conclusion of complex exchanges of ideas throughout the movie. I wont comment about technical features, because I dont have the expertise to do it. I just say that the soundtrack is somewhere near perfection, editing as well and there some beautifully shot scenes. As I said, my concern is not about that. Youth make the viewer think about life, old age, ethics, it accompanies us through some beautiful ideas, and this is where all pros and cons stay. This movie doesnt look for easy ways to impress the viewer, to make him/her somehow forcefully interested to what the screen shows, it requests an open mind and what I ironically call the 51st shade: a fetish to thoughts, not only to material things. Some people dont like Sorrentino because they consider him a radical chic intellectual. It is a righteous choice to be against intellectualism whatsoever, but it is as well righteous to be against ignorance.",True
"Getting Even with Dad The Savages has been terribly mismarketed. Im sure plenty of people who went to watch it having seen only the previews, thought it was a comedy, and were disappointed. If anything, this is a dramedy  it will make you smile a few times, but never laugh out loud. But thats not a bad thing, the other way around.This is a story about two siblings, Wendy (Laura Linney, who earned a surprise  and much deserved  Oscar nomination for this performance) and Jon Savage (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who have to take care of their ailing, estranged father, Lenny (Philip Bosco). Fathers and kids relationships have been discussed in tons of movies, but Tamara Jenkins (real life wife of Jim Taylor, coauthor of Alexander Paynes scripts  they both produced this movie, by the way) managed to create something fresh and beautiful in its own simplicity (and, at the same time, so complex and painfully real, for all of those whove had difficult family relationships  and who hasnt?). The Savages reminds me of Noah Baumbachs The Squid and the Whale, also starring Laura Linney  but with a little less humor, and perhaps even more heart. Hoffman and Bosco are also great, as usual. Jenkins proves that shes a very sensitive writer/director, and Im excited to check whatever she does next. Im rooting for either her or Diablo Cody (Juno) to win the Oscar for best original screenplay next month (coincidentally, both movies have The Velvet Undergrounds Im Sticking With You in the soundtrack). 10/10.",True
"Gandolfini is once again awkward and kind of crude but ultimately very lovable.ENOUGH SAID: Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) James Gandolfini (in one of his last film roles) costars with Julia Louis Dreyfus in this romantic comedy drama film written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. Holofcener also helmed such critically acclaimed movies as 2010s PLEASE GIVE, 2006s FRIENDS WITH MONEY and 2001s LOVELY & AMAZING. This film also costars Catherine Keener (a usual player in Holofceners movies), Toni Collette and Ben Falcone. I think its one of Gandolfinis best and most likable performances and Louis Dreyfus has never been better or more lovable as well. Fans of honest and real romantic comedies should be more than pleased.Julia Louis Dreyfus stars as Eva, a divorced massage therapist who is not looking forward to her daughter, Ellen (Tracey Fairaway), going away to college. She goes to a party with her friend Sarah (Collette), and Sarahs husband Will (Falcone), and meets Albert (Gandolfini). Albert is a divorced father whos also not looking forward to his daughter, Tess (Eve Hewson), moving away for school. Eva and Albert hit it off and begin dating, despite the fact that Eva is not physically attracted to Albert (due to him being overweight). Eva also starts giving massages to a client she met at the party as well, named Marianne (Keener). The two become friends and Marianne tells Eva a bunch of horror stories about her exhusband. When Eva learns that her ex is Albert things become complicated as she doesnt know how to tell Albert or Marianne that she knows the other.The film is funny but in a very real way; I was really impressed with how much the movie felt so true to life. It has a lot to say about attraction and relationships, as well as family and divorce. Eva and Alberts relationship is the driving point of the film and the two lead performances really make the whole thing work. Gandolfini is once again awkward and kind of crude but ultimately very lovable. Its Louis Dreyfus that really surprised me though. On SEINFELD she was so self centered and unlikeable (like all of the characters on that show, except for Kramer) so its really refreshing to see her be so adorable. Shes really sweet and so is this film; Holofcener gives the movie the perfect touch once again and proves why shes an awesome indie film director.

"Emotionally Honest A Monster Calls is the rare movie geared toward a younger demographic which refuses to pull an emotional punch. The movie explicitly states that the protagonist, Connor O Malley, is too old to be a kid and too young to be a man. The introductory tagline is the perfect way to relay the films tone to the audience. From the brutally honest acting to the gorgeously animated stories, A Monster Calls allows raw emotion to emanate from the experience. Magic on the screen happens due to the unique specificity of our hurt hero. The fantastical elements found in a typical family movie organically merge with the painful reality of adulthood. For example, a fight will begin building up in Connor and the anger will call out the monster. The monster is never a simple vicarious outlet for the young adult. Instead, the monster is a wellexecuted manifestation of perceived guilt towards a deeper truth. Liam Neesons monster revels in the humanity of the moment while also holding a magnifying glass up to it. Life continues to get worse for Connor and each appearance leads to a gradual slip of harsh reality. Refreshingly, A Monster Calls never hides that uncovering important personal insight is a painful process. The climax makes up for one of the most touching revelatory moments in modern cinema. The value of the film is revealed in how both children and adults in the audience gain a better understanding of the inherently personal nature of grief. The way we deal with a loss can come across as something else entirely for ourselves. A wide release of the film will hopefully begin to kindle in an audience a desire for introspective cinema. In a sense, specific scenarios are able to paradoxically tap into a universally human truth. Movies like A Monster Calls show a better alternative to the next soulless generic blockbuster movie.",False
"The New Vision: The Beginnings of the Beat Generation Director and cowriter (with Austin Bunn) John Krokidas have created an atmospheric visit to the beginnings of one of literary historys great movements – the Beat Generation – and in doing so have carved a fine story that combines not only the rise of the Beats but also examines the slow emergence of recognition of sexual identity crises, in both a positive and a critical manner. Cast with a group of very fine actors and accompanied with musical director Nico Muhlys sensitive score that includes the references to Brahms symphonies and trios and transcriptions of themes along with terrific excerpts from Harlems jazz scene (courtesy of Dawn Newman as a jazz singer), this film is successful on many levels, not the least of which is the reminder of the permanent impact on American literature and sociology imprinted by the likes of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs. The very sensitive opening sequence, appreciated only at films end, sets the dark tone of the film and opens the window to understanding the Beats (also called the Libertine Circle by Ginsberg).The time is the mid 1940s and Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliff) is an English major in Columbia University, assigned to be the roommate of Lucien Make me cry or make me horny Carr (Dane De Hann) who awakens Ginsbergs rebellious self and introduces him to the work of Rimbaud. Dissatisfied by the orthodox attitudes of the school, Ginsberg finds himself drawn to iconoclastic colleagues like the egotistical but genius Lucien Carr, William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston). Together, this gang would explore bold new literary ideas that would challenge Columbia Universitys staid stance and the sensibilities of their time as the future Beat Generation. However, for all their creativity, their very appetites and choices lead to more serious transgressions that would mark their lives forever. Lucien has been stalked since age 14 by the older gay David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall) who sees Lucien as his lover, but in this version of the story Lucien acted out his same sex proclivities with both Ginsberg and Kerouac. Lucien murders Kammerer and drags his body into the Hudson River (recall the opening scene of the film) and it is the advice of both Kerouac and Burroughs that leads to the judgment of the questionable verdict. Ginsberg goes on to create Howl and Kerouac moves toward On the Road and Carr becomes a journalist. Despite the at times confusing dichotomy between the murder story and the literary awakening the Beats introduced, this is a fascinating depiction of a movement of enormous impact. John Krokidas captures all the essence of the times in the 1940s New York City and his actors – especially Daniel Radcliff – bring this story to life. There is an uncredited role of Lucien Carrs mother superbly played by Kyra Sedgwick and any number of other fleeting bit parts that add to the mystique of the period.

"sex is the theme of  life The Sessions directed by Ben Lewin is based on the life of Mark O Brien, a polio stricken man in an iron lung who was a journalist and a poet( played by John Hawkes: movie Winters bone)originally from Boston who moved to Berkeley,CA. Mark was grateful that his parents did not send him to a nursing home but raised him at home so he could live long. At age of 38 ( 1988), Mark decided to lose his virginity and explore and enjoy sex. He was always supine and always either in an iron lung at home or on a gurney when outside. He finally decides to seek the help of a paid sex surrogate who is definitely different from a hooker. Cheryl(played by Helen Hunt)is a sex surrogate. Cheryl is intelligent, educated,married and has a nice body. Cheryl and Mark decide to go through six sessions of sex and self awareness. Cheryl makes Mark aware of his and her body. John Hawkes acted brilliantly . His facial expressions and glittering eyes are very enticing and evoke respect and sympathy. I particularly liked the way Mark describes his first session of intimacy: cleansed and victorious. Helen Hunt as Cheryl is excellent. All the nude scenes are sophisticated and stylishly done. William Macy as Father Brendan is excellent. Screenplay is excellent and conversations between Father Brendan and Mark are interesting.

"to rank among the 5 best movies made in 2003Lets say it straight away: before Mystic River (2003), Clint Eastwoods last works had left me a little unsatisfied; particularly Blood Work (2002), a watchable thriller with a certain charm but without great originality. But the following year, with Mystic River, he made a sensational comeback and quite obviously this movie, which critically and commercially gave a boost to his career is his most accomplished since Unforgiven (1992).By watching Mystic River one can feel that Clint Eastwood, more than ever put a lot of effort into the elaboration of his movie. From a subtle screenplay written by Brian Helgeland who shows that he is a far better scriptwriter than director (as far as Im concerned, I hated the rather insipid A Knights Tale 2001), Eastwood develops an absorbing and ingenious directing which contributes in weaving a shady and even stifling by moments atmosphere. On another extent, Eastwood takes back a way that had worked for him in Blood Work: favoring calm and patience. And indeed, on an unhurried pace, the filmmaker takes all his time to shot the evolution of this detective story. More important, he made this choice for another reason: to do a thorough psychological study of the three main characters. The basis of Mystic River consists in a classic detective investigation (nevertheless passionating in its construction) doubled with a relevant description of the three main protagonists.To watch Mystic River is like to find oneself on the edge of a forest and to disappear into it. The more the movie progresses, the more we discover three heartbroken characters because they are linked by dark events. First, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn). We learn that he has flirted with violence and has spent a few years in jail but he seems to have become a wellbehaved man: he works in a grocery store and regularly goes to church. But the death of his daughter crushed him and he is determined to avenge her. Then, Sean Divine (Kevin Bacon) who appears as a reliable and lucid cop but whose private life is hell: he experienced a failed marriage and his wife keeps on harassing him day and night. At last, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), a broken father who underwent a deep traumatic experience (he was kidnapped and raped by two men who claimed to be priests). The consequences are terrible: he cant communicate anymore, he cant defend himself anymore and he wanders like a ghostly figure in the streets of his neighborhood. As a matter of fact, this traumatic scene is at the root of the three characters misfortunes. Being the very first sequence of the movie, it sets the tone of Clint Eastwoods 24th movie. It presents Jimmy, Sean and Dave playing in a street. The sky is gray, the houses of the neighborhood are bare and austere. The ball which disappears through the manhole may symbolize the loss of childhood. Then, a big black car arrives. One of the men gets out and claims to be a priest (or does he?). He orders Dave to go into the car and the latter drives away. This moment will haunt the three boys for the rest of the lives and will deeply influence their personality. Roughly, Mystic River demonstrates in a conclusive way how such a past dramatic event can influence our present lives.In virtually all the critics I have read, Mystic River was hailed for its cast. Its true that Penn, Bacon and Robbins rank among the best American actors of their generation and I think we will never thank Eastwood enough for having reunited them. By giving a lot of depth to their respective characters, one can feel that they were giving their all, which can explain why the movie was shot in a rather short time (39 days). They may even never battle their dazzling performances. And the rest of the cast is just as equal as the whole, especially the actresses whose female characters have an important role in the story since they influence (unconsciously or not) their husbands actions and characters.To a third degree, Eastwoods major work is also used to denounce the deceptive superficiality of the appearances, the omnipresence of violence and the credulity of many inhabitants. The film opens with an overview of the neighborhood but doesnt show yet that it is devastated by violence. No matter what the time is. Violence is omnipresence and the fact that it touches younger generations proves that it isnt ready to subside.At last, lets also congratulate Eastwood for the remarkable music he has signed himself with his son. With this music, simplicity rhymes with efficiency. One has just to listen to a few notes to feel an intense emotion inside us.In the middle of all these qualities, there are just minor faults. So, Bacon is a tormented cop due to his disastrous marriage and however, we really dont know what went wrong with his wife. Is it Daves kidnapping? Is it his trying job? This point remains ambiguous. Ambiguous is also the adjective that suits the best to qualify the end of the film. What can mean the gesture Bacon makes to Penn? But these two points let freely the way to any possible interpretation.The contribution of the crew in Eastwoods work is total and so is my enthusiasm for Mystic River. If you havent seen it yet, go and watch it. You wont regret it. At the age of 73 years old, grandad Clint Eastwood is still in great form and given the recent triumph of Million Dollar Baby (2004), he seems to have decided to bring the house down again in the landscape of American cinema for our greatest pleasure.",True
"Well what can I say...I absolutely loved the movie, its the second time Im seeing it and Im glad I did, because I love epic dramas...and this one well, not only did it have a great and an original storyline, it had a great cast also. But my favorite had to be Brad Pitt, his performance was engaging and I couldnt take my eyes off the screen, because I simply was fascinated by the way the story was constructed. Ive read a few comments made here...and this film is everything but predictable. It has so many twists and turns that it just keeps you wondering until the end...where you feel like youve watched the film to its fullest and theres no more stories left untold, thats what I look for in a good film. Even though the story was tragic, it was a story of love, loyalty and family. I give it a 9/10...if you havent seen this movie yet...SEE IT! Youll love it, even if you dont fancy Brad Pitt.",False
"Let down by pacing issues This story is a brilliant story to tell! The cast is a fantastic cast! Washington is perfectly cast, Driver is in his element, Grace is a diamond in a gold mine.

"Chris Colfer is just brilliant.Struck by Lightning hit me hard, it touched me, made me laugh and left me relieved when it was finished. I have to say it was actually Rebel Wilson that made me want to watch this movie. Shes as always hilarious no matter what she does. Chris Colfer is definitely one of the best young actors in Hollywood today and i think that the idea he had with Struck By Lightning came through in the end. Its about not standing back and not to let others push you around. To do everything you can to ensure your future (it is after all survival of the fittest). You wont be wasting your time...if youre into teen movies this is a must see. If they keep making movies like this I think therell be a bright future ahead.",False
"Sublime Peter Bogdonovichs great love of film, combined with Larry Mc Murtrys superior storytelling (he wrote the novel and both collaborated on the script), is in glorious evidence in this elegiac study of life in a small Texas town in the early Fifties. Bogdonovich pays a heartfelt tribute to the America of John Ford and Howard Hawks but the subject matter is contemporary, anguished, appropriate for the time in which it was made. Filmed by the great Robert Surtees in a flat black and white that perfectly evokes the bleakness of rural Texas life and peppered with a fine soundtrack of the popular country hits of the time, Bogdonovich creates a mise en scene understated and keenly observant of the details. Its also filled with Mc Murtrys trademark mix of humor and pathos. The cast (including Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Ellen Burstyn and Cloris Leachman) is letterperfect but its Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion who gives the film its center: in an overwhelming (yet masterfully restrained) performance, Johnson unforgettably absorbs the towns despair, loneliness and regret; his short monologue about lost love is delivered with such deceptive simplicity that its power sneaks up on you unawares. One of the great performances and one of the groundbreaking films of the Seventies.",False
"A raunchy, funny roller coaster youve already ridden before Select All. Cut. Open New Document. Paste. Thesaurus. Print. I can nearly guarantee you this was the process in writing the sequel to the most successful Rrated comedy of alltime. In one of the craziest and most blatant filmmaking moments of carbon copying an earlier installment I have ever witnessed Hangover II paces, moves, and delivers in the exact same method, style and speed as the original. The musical transitions are the same, some of the setups are the same, some of the conflicts and revelations were eerily alike and worst of all, the entire third act felt like the originaland they are thousands of miles from the United States. Every strength in this movie is deterred by the fact that Todd Phillips and company put no effort in trying to change things up a little aside from setting.Is the movie still funny? Yes, it is funny and there are indeed some standout moments. But, all the freshness and originality of the first Hangover is definitely not present here, and it hurts more because they could have fixed some of the setbacks of the original. This time Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand in order to gain approval from his fiancées father. During a night of drinking with the Wolfpack (Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Justin Bartha) and the fiancées brother, something went wrong, and the crew is many miles away in Bangkok. And of course, one of them is missing. And of course, they dont remember anything. And of course, they are mixed up in multiple situations occurring within the city. The difference between this one and their stint in Vegas is that the stakes are much higher, as the adventure in Thailand is much more grim and dark than in Sin City. Hangover part one was hilarious, unique, and had flair of comedic originality. However, it needed a few polishes in order to become a true comedic classic. Zach as Allen is the biggest of the flaws. His characterization in the original was very uneven, too random, and just didnt deliver as much sympathy as the other characters. In the sequel, he is ruder, crueler, and an absolute pain to witness. In the original his actions are mildly justified because of his stupidity. Here however the stupid act gets old extremely fast. It doesnt help that Galifianakis doesnt have the comedic timing that superior funnymen possess. The rest of the cast throughout the movie was great, with Ed Helms and Ken Jeong being the best examples. Todd Phillips should have known better, as he is a good director with a nice track record. I am extremely disappointed that instead of taking an approach to trying something new while still offering the same type of Rrated college humor, he chose to stick to the formula far too close. You can copy some of the jokes and get away with it, but to imitate the entire threeact structure of the original Hangover is nothing more than lazy and uninspired filmmaking. He still has a few tricks up his sleeve with a few raunchy and hilarious surprises, but far too much potential was wasted in order for me to forgive him. Bottom Line: You will most likely have a good time watching this if you enjoyed the original. That being said, it will feel exactly like the originalexcept its in Bangkok and the setting is much darker. They cranked the ante in conflict, but failed to improve anything or change anything from the 2009 comedy smash hit. Playing it safe hindered this movie, as part of Hangovers appeal was its inability to stick to a formula. Hangover II is funny, but lacks the satisfaction, zaniness, and appeal of the original. Hopefully they can spice things up for the third installment (you know its coming out, stop lying to yourself) otherwise all I have to do is copy this review and paste it to the third chapter. diac1987.blogspot.com Entire Planet Observed on Daily Basis",False

The premise of the film is about one mans struggle to do the right thing at when everything around him is going wrong. Don Cheadle is the best African American actor out there. His passion and heart was so strong that moved me almost to tears. There is a definite wish here to let this story to be known to the world.

"Very Good I doubt I would have ever rented the film, it looked too much like just a teenage love story. However, a friend whos taste I respect, recommended it. I thought the film was excellent. The Man in The Moon is one of those rare movies that gets it right. A warm and tender story of a family, and growing up, without being maudlin. It was the first time Id seen Reese Witherspoon, and she was indeed impressive. You knew she had something special about her, like seeing a very young Elizabeth Taylor, in an old MGM movie. This film is idealized, yet honest. Many of us grow up with both joys and some pain, and there is  an unexpected twist, that when it hits  it hits  hard.",True

"Lynchs Most Famous Movie? I Think So This has always been a unique crime movie, like no story I have seen before or since. In numerous ways, its a sick film...but utterly fascinating, even after a handful of viewings. Its a certainly a trademark of director David Lynch with its bizarre story and twists and strange characters.This movie has one of the most evil characters ever put on screen: Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper. The latter is known for playing psychotic killers and this role tops them all. Hopper was never sicker. Almost as bizarre as him is the female victim in here, Dorothy Vallens, played a mysterious Isabella Rossellini.Kyle Mac Laclan is good as the nosy lateteen who just has to find out what is going on in Dorothys apartment while girlfriend Laura Dern gets caught up in his curiosity.In a movie that features strange characters, the strangest scene of them  and there are a number  is in Booths apartment with Dean Stockwell and his friends. Stockwells lipsynching to an old Roy Orbison song is really freaky. Make no mistake, though: as bizarre as this film can get, its mostly a very suspenseful crime story that can get very uncomfortable to watch at times. The language in this film was surprisingly tame.....until Hopper enters the scene. Hes about the only character who uses profanity but he makes up for the others by using the fword in about every sentence. He is so overthetop, though, that after the initial shock seeing this movie once or twice, I know almost laugh out loud at him and way he acts. Visually and audibly, this is another interesting Lynch movie with superb colors, creepy camera angles and a diverse soundtrack. You hear everything from lush classical music to old rock n roll songs, and a bunch of bizarre noises (sound effects). From discussions Ive had, this seems to be a film people love or hate. There is not much room for middle ground. Lynch has done much nicer films such as The Straight Story, crazier films (Wild At Heart, Eraserhead) and classier movies (The Elephant Man) but this will be his trademark film: the one above others he will be remembered for, good or bad.",True
"Dont judge this movie with its trailer In my opinion the biggest problem and the reason for all the down votes of this movie is its trailer. I also thought this movie was going to be a fullon comedy. Seeing Jason Sudeikis,Kristen Wiig in the trailer; all the jokes made me believe this is going to be funny to watch. Well, both of them were in the movie for like 7 minutes. Also there was this anticipation of experiencing how the small world would be but that also is a really tiny part of the movie.This movie is much more than the trailer offers but unfortunately it also is much less than it too.

"Fantastic directoral debut Drew Barrymore is well known for her quirky acting and distinct personality. But now movie goers across the country will begin seeing her in a new light director.Whip It, which stars Ellen Page (Juno), Marcia Harden, and several other notable actors/actresses is a fun filled, action packed, emotional film that forces you to give an old fashioned thumbs up as you leave.Page is fantastic in her role, perfectly capturing the rebellious, curious character of Bliss Cavendar. Her innocent face leaves you rooting for her while at the same time wondering if her decisions are ultimately right. Harden again plays her role flawlessly, down to her own hidden dreams disguised under her thick shell.Unlike most rise to the top movies, Whip It is believable. It seems real at all times. It feels as though all of us at one point in our lives were like Bliss, longing to live a different life.If you want a great night at the movies, if you want a solid movie with enjoyable memories, and if you want to answer that question of I wonder how Drew Barrymore would be as a director, go see Whip It.

"On The Wire One of the most gleefully indulgent, selfloathing films ever made yet watchable as a train wreck, thanks to its bravery, wit and overall excellence.Scheider is unexpectedly effective as the directors mirror image, a talented louse who deserves what he gets.  I can only imagine the smirk that must have been on Fosses face throughout this production.  He doesnt ask for forgiveness, he doesnt try to justify Gideons behavior, and he certainly didnt encourage Scheider to be sympathetic.  Youre right, Im a bastard, he seems to be saying.While catchy and professional, the musical numbers (particularly the art direction and costumes) range from tasteless to bombastic as they were intended, I think.  The choreography is precise, the editing masterful, and the performances in sharp focus.  These elements, plus the acerbically mournful script, make for a fascinating deconstruction of self to an extent rarely, if ever, seen in the movies.Not every artist should think himself so interesting, but thankfully, both Fosses professional and personal life merited such honest examination.  I cant think of any of our more iconic filmmakers today who have been turned the camera back on themselves in such unflinching fashion.Note:  Among the direct parallels to Fosses actual career are The Stand Up to Lenny, and Lithgows snooty Lucas Sergeant to theatres estimable Harold Prince.",False
"Right on the Money and on the Fraud The Big Short is a winner. Based on Michael Lewis book of the same title, it tells the sorry story of the fraud and deceit practiced on the American people, nay, on the world by Wall Streets finance capitalism. We know the culprits: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Bros., Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Wachovia, Crdit Suisse, UBS and on and on who invented financial instruments such as CDO, credit swaps and other fancy unintelligible names, based on mortgages, with the connivance of the credit agencies Dow Jone, Standard and Poors and Fitch. The Big Short with a light seriousness is a crash course on the duplicity of Wall Street investment bankers who earned large fees on junk bonds with triple A ratings; who bundled junk to palm off on an unsuspecting public looking for big gains by pandering to the snake oil exilir of getting rich quickly; and who feed on the niavety of the broad American havenots with the dream of owning a home of their own.

"Starts well, then collapses under the weight of its own self satisfaction This is a film that looks outstanding. It has that feel of the best seventies cinema. The acting similarly is outstanding but still, a few things stop it from being the stone cold classic it could have been. The cracks started to show when Cogan(Pitt) has his first talk with Mickey(Gandolfini). Its the latest in a long series of head to heads that play out more like acting masterclasses than anything relating to the film. That scene effectively breaks the spell and reminds us that we are watching good quality acting combined with a good script.The film seems to go off the rails after this. Any charm or involvement is soon stopped by another showy scene from the director who seems more concerned with showing off his film making skills than actually making a good film.The final thing that jars is Brad Pitt. He had the same effect on Fight Club. Pitt is too big a star for a film like this. He simply doesnt convince as the cynical cold blooded killer. Why would such a man spend that much time on his physical appearance for instance?. A more earthy, hard boiled actor could have made the character believable. Not a bad film but overbearingly condescending at the finale (which I wont spoil here). The film that went before doesnt earn that pay off and its impact isnt felt on the screen. Which makes the end deeply unsatisfying. Shame really as with more editing and less egos involved, this could have been so much better.",False

Although the influence of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese can be felt throughout the whole film, P.T.

"Beautifully Acted: He Loved His Horn and His Heroin Ethan Hawke stars in this beautifully acted portrayal of jazz trumpeter and singer Chet Baker during his prime. Know that the film treats the facts of Bakers actual biography, as one reviewer said, more like a chord chart than a score and riffs from there. What is truetolife is that Baker was an only child, born on a lonely ranch in Yale, Oklahoma, and went on to have numerous relationships with women and a longterm relationship with heroin. Musically, he was a progenitor of West Coast Swing, but always had his eye on the New York scene, with the mantra: Look out Dizzy, look out, Miles. Theres a little white California boy coming for you. An accident when Baker was 12 caused him to lose a front tooth, after which he had to relearn to play the trumpet. That was a mere warmup to the effort he had to put in after his drug dealer pistolwhipped him and knocked out all of his front teeth, destroying his embouchure. Yet, he couldnt stay away from heroin. He thought it made his playing better, and he was all about his music. While Baker had a great talent for improvisation and sustaining a melodic line, he had no talent at all for being happy. After one important comeback milestone, his manager (Callum Keith Rennie) asks, Would you try to be happy for more than ten seconds? This line provides the ironic overlay to the choice of title for the film, one of Bakers big hits. Hawke did the films vocals; the trumpet playing was by Canadian trumpeter Kevin Turcotte. Written and directed by Robert Budreau, the movie has an opening scene that shows how a girl he picked up after a performance casually introduced him to heroin, and he didnt say no. This scene turns out to be part of a movie being made about him and whether such a significant life event happened in such an offhand way, we dont know. The insertion of black and white scenes, some of which may be from the movie (which was never finished) or from his memory, plays with the order of events, especially early in the film, an improvisational approach to history that mimics jazz music itself. Although Baker does get clean for a several years as he is recovering his playing ability, a return to heroin remains a risk in the music business. As his parole officer says, You go into a barber shop and sit in the chair long enough, youre going to get a haircut. Still, his parole officer, his girlfriend—the delectable Carmen Ejogo (playing a composite of several women)—his manager, and many musicians wanted him to succeed, including Dizzie Gillespie and Gerry Mulligan. Miles Davis, notoriously prickly, was not a fan, and well get a chance to get his side of the story in the biopic with Don Cheadle, coming soon.",False
"An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolans filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how its not Christopher Nolans best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, ill talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a scifi epic like no other. To compare said film to 2001: A Space Odyssey isnt just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubricks vision of Arthur C. Clarkes scifi epic wasnt to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolans films). But its so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, its tearjerking and emotional throughout. The acting is topnotch, especially Mc Conaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when theyre on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the films bold and breathtaking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whoms work inspired the films genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, theres the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue ive ever heard in a scifi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Dont just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say its The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, theres The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you cant deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I cant wait to see what he does next, but im not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",True
"Dont really know what to think....SPOILER WARNING....Now i will be commenting on a few things in the film but whether or not they can be considered spoilers i will leave up to you, my own personal opinion is that a film must first have a plot before it can be spoiled in any way.      Well i just finished watching this film 20 minutes ago so im writing this fairly fresh and still havent completely formed an opinion of it, its probably best me writing these comments in this state of mind because most of you will probably be thinking the same thing.I watched this film without reading any reviews seeing any ratings or hearing about it through word of mouth, after 2 minutes of seeing Micheal Pitt as Blake you will clearly see Kurt Cobain, 30 minutes later you will be slightly confused by just what the hell you are watching and for a time this movie will seem like a chore to watch and if im honest it just carrys on like that.So why then did i give it 7 out of 10? Because roughly an hour into the film i was actually impressed by something, up until this point in the film all you see is a blonde skinny guy fumbling around looking like his half way to falling asleep or down a flight of stairs, this is pretty much what you have watched up to now. Then he starts playing guitar and singing, now i have been a Nirvana fan since i was 13 years old and that spans almost half my life time, this one scene reminded me why. Its a shame this is a movie site otherwise i could carry on with a review that could get me hired by rolling stone, but it isnt so i wont.To sum up, if your looking for a source of entertainment please forgive me for the caps and DO NOT WATCH THIS. This is not a film you watch to be entertained in any form, if you watch this searching for something to give you a thrill or move you in anyway you will most likely be let down by it, an example of why this would be so? how about at one point in the film you are watching a TV showing a Boyz 2 Men video for the entire duration.However, if you want to watch a film with some incredible acting, great direction and is a good deal different to anything else thats had a decent size release to it lately this might be for you.It may also be worth it for Nirvana fans to check out. ;)",False
"The stars cant save it As a fan of four key people in the cast (De Niro, Keaton, Williams, Sarandon), it was pretty much a given that I was going to see this, even if the ads told me that I was destined for a rough ride.There was a certain stripe of madefor TV movie in the 1980s and early 90s, movies with titles like Crash Course and Baby of the Bride. They featured casts bursting with stars of all the thenhot series (Jackee, Rue Mc Clanahan, etc.) and wacky premises (a wacky drivers ed school! a pregnant old woman!) and were just as terrible as they looked in the ads. The Big Wedding, from its title to its awful script, is just the bigscreen version of one of those disposable madefor TV clunkers. The only thing setting it apart is the caliber of star they managed to get for this crapfest and the sexual situations involved in some of the plot. Even De Niros raunchy dialogue seems forced, as if the filmmakers were desperate to set their movie apart from bad TV movies.That said, I expected that at least the cast would make it worthwhile. I mean, weve all watched movies just for the cast, or seen otherwise lousy movies that were redeemed to some degree by a favorite actor. None of that is the case here. De Niros been phoning it in for the last decade or so, and this is no exception. Keaton plays the same role shes been playing since Somethings Gotta Give put her back on the radar. Sarandon acquits herself. But worst of all is Williams, who has less than five minutes on screen in a part anyone couldve played. It actually feels as if he was directed NOT to ad lib or have any fun with the role. Its an extended cameo that he couldve made shine, but there is NO Robin Williamsness in his performance. Overall, no one in the main cast performs with any personality.In short, dont see it unless youre completing your checklist of one of the main stars filmographies. And even then, be prepared to be sorely disappointed.",False
Excellent This is a wonderful movie. A lot more of an action flick than title suggests. Was a pleasant surprise as plot unfolded. Ben Affleck is perfect for this part. Well written script and good acting by all. Nice use of flashbacks for character development. Many twists and turns and a bit of a surprise ending. Watch it! You wont be disappointed.,False
"Finally!!!I got a chance to see Batman Begins just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the Batman film weve been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, This is it! This is the movie! I just cant believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolans decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film thats so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the films star. And rightly so. Its amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grownup. Her performance isnt bad per SE, its just that you really dont buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldnt tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and Im definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.",False
"Palme de Bronze, peutetre You have to be astonished that this one collected a Palme. Not least, it evidently lies in the shadow of Haneke, winner of two recent Palmes for much better movies. The satire on the art world, the rattling of the bourgeoisie, both seem too overdrawn to be effective. Sketches go on too long, as when the museum director videos his apology, or the apeman detonates the society party. Cutaways that dont happen, or do but are merely irritating, seem like unsuccessful adaptions of Hanekes grating style. A few folks left my screening up around the 90 minute mark, their patience evidently worn thin. Theyd seen the best of it, like the directors fling with the journo. Now, if you really want to see someone stick it right up the bourgeoisie, you cant go past Hanekes mordant misbehaviour in Bennys Video (1992).",False
"Worth Your Time Reviews for A Love Song for Bobby Long are falling in the range from terrible to fantastic. My vote is closer to the fantastic end. The movie gets off to a slow start, but starts to work about a quarter into the film. The story unfolds at a slow pace; fitting for its locale. The character development for the three main characters (Travolta, Johansson and Macht) is wellwoven into the story. Each character is flawed and through a series of events overcomes their problem. That to me is interesting moviemaking. No storyline or subplot was left hanging at the end. Maybe I was tired, but I didnt see the end of the movie coming in the first five minutes as one comment stated. This movie is worth your time.",False
"The Dragon Nun and The Wimp I was taken aback by the lack of nuance and subtlety. Meryl Streep is a monstrous nun from the very beginning and Philip Seymour Hoffman is a wimp that can shout but remains a wimp. I just didnt believe any of it, which is a pity because this are among my favorite actors of all time. I think that John Patrick Shanley (the writer, director) didnt have enough muscle to handle this enormous talents. Meryls nun couldnt hide anywhere, she carries her intolerance, frustration and repression on her sleeve. She knows she is hated but according to her, thats her job. No, I didnt believe it. I thought what Vanessa Redgrave, Liv Ullman, Helen Mirren even Cherry Jones who played her on the stage could have done with this creature and then, Philip Seymour Hoffmans priest, without a single vibe of sexuality, imagine what Montgomery Clift could have done with that! After saying what Ive said I also have to add that the film is never boring and that is also merit of the miscast leads. They are great fun to watch. The film is dedicated to Sister James, the young nun played by the wonderful Amy Adams, so this is based on a real case? I dont believe that either.",True
"How to create something out of nothing? Ask Mark Andrus and Jim L. Brooks Really, how to make something original, fresh and odd out of absolutely nothing except a few characters? Using characters, only characters and nothing except characters. Thats the simple formula Brooks uses in all of his work, but, for me, he has never created so much charm, warmth and sensibility as he did in `As good as it gets.Characters write the screenplay in this movie, and everything that happens  happens because of what they are. They are nothing special  they are ordinary people we meet in the street every day and that have the same problems a lot of other people have. This movie presents the example of how much you can pull out of that. And if that is written as well as it is in this case, not even a happy ending can bother you. Because, in real life, shown here, what is the end?Everything is good and warm in this movie, everything is fresh and vivacious, understandable and well performed. Jack Nicholson brings one of the best performances of his career, that terrific Helen Hunt finally got a chance to show how skilfully an actor can connect naturalism with the laws of the camera performance, and Greg Kinnear shows the most convincing emotions coming from a gay character Ive ever seen.The relationships between the characters are created in the way that you cant predict anything thats going to happen, eventhough you know in advance what could come out of their mouth and what kind of attitude theyll have in a certain situation.You can simply feel the progressive collaboration that occurred between Brooks and the actors and the mutual understanding they developed, and its not often that you see that kind of artistic superstructure shining on the screen so much as it does here.I find `As good as it gets complexed, vital, intelligent, emotionally deep and studied, fresh, original, amusing, cheerful, funny, and one of the best films of 1997.",False
"Dont understand all the hate.Before i saw this movie i looked at some peoples opinions about it and i saw mostly negative reviews, so i was really nervous going into this movie thinking that i would have had the same reaction to it and seriously i have no idea what those people are talking about. So War for the planet of the apes is the 3rd film in the new prequel/Reboot of the planet of the apes movies. And this is about Caeser going on a journey to stop a war between his apes and an army of highly trained soldiers, while he also tries to control his more violent instincts. First the obvious, the CGI is amazing and is truly a technological marvel to cinema. Andy Serkis once again plays the ape ruler Caesar and is easily the best movie character in recent years, in each film he has gotten progressively better and in this one it is definitely the best performance. The story is great and is well acted throughout. This movie is also an amazing drama. There are a lot of moments that just make you jerk a tear every once in a while and its believable. The action sequences are pretty good too. Woody Harrelson plays the colonel and he does a pretty good job at it (He is not as good as koba but still good). He is just a character that you can relate to and you understand why he is doing all of this. Caesar and the colonel are pretty relatable. As much as i would love to say how great this movie is, i better stop right here. I loved every part of this movie and i did not find anything i did not like about it, but i am gonna talk about why i think most people were disappointed with this film. So if you watched all the trailers and looked at the title you may be expecting one thing, a ton of apes and humans fighting with guns and rockets. But although there is some of that in this movie, its definitely not the main point of it. This movie to its core is about the war that a person faces emotionally while war is happening around him. We see this concept with Caesar all the way through the movie. It also talks about what terrible things a person or people would do in a war. Woody Harrelsons character does what he does because he believes that the entire human race is going to go extinct if he does not act. I mean, would you do that if you knew that you could slowly be replaced by another species? So some people do not like this film because they were expecting a full on hardcore war movie. And it is that, but it really is a commentary about how a person has a war within themselves when war is happening around them. And people either missed, did not care, or did not understand the more darker themes about this movie. But anyway, in the end i thought this movie was a masterpiece in every way it could have been. It has amazing CGI, performances, action sequences, dark themes, tear jerking moments, and a beautiful moral to it. A+ or 10/10 APES TOGETHER STRONG!",False
"11:14 Edgy, Smart, Terrific Festival.  Based on what Id read, I was expecting some sort of Tarantino ripoff.Instead I got run over by a very fast, very clever film.  Directed by 27 year old Greg Marcks, the film is populated by up and coming young stars including Colin Hanks and Rachael Leigh Cook.  Its actually 5 stories that all take place in a small town in middle America at around 11pm on a random night.Characters keep running into each other and bad bad things happen, but the stories are all strung together in really clever, often darkly funny ways. The dialog is sharp and real, and Marcks has a real skill with his young cast. There are some really excellent performances, especially by Rachael Leigh Cook, who as the trashy Cherie is just the right combination of evil and desperate.Although even in her trailer park costume shes breathtakingly beautiful! Also look for Ben Foster, who surprised me with a very realistic performance, after something REALLY bad happens to him.  Hanks is also good, as is Shawn Hatosy.  I was blown away!  And the strangest part of the Premiere screening?  It finished at exactly 11:14.",False
"Inhale Youll need to inhale, then exhale slowly and relax before plunging into the world of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), lobbyist and bag man for the Tobacco Industry. The laughs are some of the best abdominal exercise Ive ever had at the movies. Thank You for Smoking is far and away the best satire to come out of Hollywood in years. The last attempt I remember was WAG THE DOG. This film is far better at true satire, its wit biting dogooders and dobadders alike. It has been too long since Satire and the Politically Incorrect Sense of Humor have been allowed to point out the absurd in all sides of an issue. If you dont laugh out loud, your sense of humor has become a casualty of malpractice by the Doctors of Spin and the Nursemaids of Political Correctness.Young Jason Reitmans direction and screenplay are deft and light. He is never heavyhanded, or worse, condescending (as may have happened more than once in WAG THE DOG). Based on a novel by Christopher Buckley (the son of William F. Buckley), the script is the star here. The double, triple, and sometimes quadruple entendres are spoken conversationally by a starstudded ensemble cast, who clearly revel in great material and great lines. Every reviewer opines that this will be Aaron Eckharts breakout role. With his Dudley Do Right face and that guy who always gets the girl on crack charm and glibness, his Nick Naylor is the ultimate purveyor of the spin doctors prescription: the means justify the end.The casting director should be congratulated in the same breath as the director. Rob Lowe as the genius behind Hollywood EGO, a consultant firm which helps raise financing for movies with strategic product placement, is noteperfect in a small role. With William H. Macy, the Vermont Senator who takes on the tobacco industry, Maria Bello, a fellow Merchant of Death lobbyist, and Robert Duvall, the Captain of this particular industry the cast is jawdropping, and sublimely funny. Katie Holmes, pre Tom Kat, is gorgeous, seductive, and completely believable as the reporter who stops at nothing to get her story.Nick Naylors relationship with his son is the lens which focuses Nick on his own behavior. Even that relationship is not treated as a cliché, or completely reverently by the satirist, who remains true to the last frame to the goal of letting the air out of our selfrighteousness. It is a breath of fresh air. I not only recommend it, I intend to see it again.",True
"Performances Outpace Story In every actors career there comes a moment where the critics and audiences rally around jumping for joy about how theyve just witnessed a breakthrough performance. As stunning as these performances are, the term breakthrough always felt a little out of place to me since its only on rare occasions the actor in question is relatively new. Most times they are people who have been pounding the boards and scraping the screen for years. In those terms, the breakthrough is nothing more than a large group of people seeing that actor in a new light for the first time, mostly in something they never imagined before. Now the newly colored spotlight falls on Anne Hathaway and her powerful turn as Kym in Rachels Getting Married.The film is a slice of life piece detailing a small space of time, only a few days, where Kym returns home from a rehab clinic just in time for her sister Rachels wedding. Anyone who has ever taken part in arranging a wedding, especially one taking place in the family home, knows the extreme stress already present, so toss a young, partially unstable girl into the mix and top it off with a nice coating of family denial and dark skeletons in the hallway closet, then you get the full picture of this film. Relationships are strained, ties pulled so tight and taut they could snap and still they try to work it out through screaming, laughing and crying (not necessarily in that order). After all, its about a wedding, whos not happy at those? Before giving Anne her due credit, let me shed some light on someone most people wont know off the top of their heads. Rosemarie De Witt plays the title role of Rachel and she does it with the utmost tenderness and subtlety. What she brings across is the inherent hatred, resentment and unending compassion sisters can feel for each other, even through the worst of storms. With a film more comfortable in the category of ensemble piece, Rosemarie is the catalyst and pushes the energy along, changing and charging every one of her scenes. But the light shines brightest on Anne Hathaway as Kym, the exjunkie, exalcoholic, exreturn rehab patient bordering on becoming an exfamily member. Audiences claim this as a breakthrough performance because they fell in love with Anne in The Princess Diaries movies, Ella Enchanted and the wonderfully wicked The Devil Wears Prada. Yet what they might not remember is shes played rougher, tougher roles in Havoc and Brokeback Mountain, showing the more mature and adult side of her skills. So I wasnt all that shocked to witness the brilliance she brought to this film, but I will celebrate it all the same. Anne jumps in and exposes a vulnerability, a cavern of pain and lost love, which drives the emotional core of the picture. From opening credits to the closing moment, she is the elephant in the room everyone must deal with and the magical point is this is the first time where the audience can begin to empathize with the elephant and not the onlookers. I cant end the acting portion of this review without bringing up Bill Irwin and Debra Winger as well. Bill plays her father and churns out a tenderness only an accomplished actor such as himself could generate. There are such small moments, such tiny fractures in his facade which allow you to peer into the heart of a man trying to choose between his greatest love and his greatest loss. On the other side, Debra Winger plays her mother, who has chosen to block out the pain in her past and skate by the rest of her life, allowing the blackness and hurt to fester and suffocate any chance at a real connection with her daughters. As you can read, the acting on display here is sensational and will undoubtedly be remembered during awards season.As a total film, Im not sure the story reaches the same heights. A lot of great scenes and spectacular moments are created, but the story lacks cohesion. A particular subplot about the family and its deep love for music is mentioned and referred to over and over, but never fully explained or explored, which weighs down later scenes during the wedding celebration and the overlong musical sequences. During most of the musical moments, all I really wanted was to get back to the story, back to the family and to Kym. Also, the connection between Rosemarie and her soontobe husband Sydney (played by Tunde Adebimpe) never quite comes across. There is a wonderful moment during their wedding vows, but it could have been helped even more if their relationship had been more centered earlier on.On the directing front, Jonathan Demme, with the assistance of a touchingly tender script from Jenny Lumet, helps craft a reality we can all believe in, a home we can all feel weve been to before. Much of this intimacy and nuance came from the free form style of camera movement, with the actors never knowing where and when the camera was going to appear on them. Everyone was basically playing everything from the moment he yelled action, so there were emotional surprises around every pan of the camera. That technique gave the movie a certain level of improv or even documentary feeling, like the audience was the most silent of voyeurs.Recommendation: A powerful series of moments, filled with terrific acting, that dont quite come together as a film. Certainly has great value to witness, but the theater experience might not be necessary. Also, this really is meant for those viewers not afraid to open themselves up to it.",False
"MY CHILDHOOD DREAM (To be one of them,The GOONIES)Well,well,well.......this film has became one of my alltime favorite movie!The first time i watched the movie i just couldnt help myself wishing I was there with them.The movie is so full of adventure!But what really bothered me was the exact date it was filmed!Oh my gosh it was dated back in 1985!I was not even born by that time.....But hey they did a pretty good job!I wish i could owned this in DVD so i can watched anytime & show this to my children.But it was so hard to find. So i guess i just had to stick to our cable.It was amazing to see Sean Astin(Mikey)so young and active.You could certainly see the difference he is now in Lord of the Rings trilogy. The story isnt like any...it was so unique!The place and view are awesome and was actually filmed in the City of Astoria.My favorite character is Mikey and Josh.They are two brothers who wants to help their parents.So Mikey,being the youngest wants to find that treasure to save them from Troys dad.My favorite lines were.... When you look in the sky,it will be another town,when you see your friends,it will be in another school.Its kinda touchy and sentiment....but good!I remember the new album of Ataris(So long Astoria)where it became one of their song.I was reading the lyrics and there was a similarity in the movie.The last part goes like this,So long Astoria,i found a map to buried treasure and even if we come home emptyhanded we still have our stories of pirate ships & wounded hearts,broken bones and the best of friendships.& when this hourglass out its final grain of sand.I raised my glass to the memories we had.This is my wish,im taking them back,Im taking them all back.I remember mouth said the last lines when they were trapped inside the cave.I guess the band members of Ataris saw the movie in their childhood years and like them,we were spellbinded by its great story.So long The Goonies,you will be remembered as one of the most amazing movies we had.Just like the movie,The relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks only theyre gone faster than the smell of the rain.But for now,you became a resurrected memories from ashes in our childhood dreams.......",False
"A fascinating film about the strategy of two great snipersIn Enemy at the Gates, the future of the greatest battle of World War II, would be decided between a young Russian sniper and an aristocratic sharpshooter from Germany sent to kill him Jude Law and Ed Harris sit for hours waiting for the right moment It was a duel set in the siege of Stalingrad Stalingrad was one of the biggest and bloodiest battles of World War II, and in the midst of this huge battle, these two soldiers were hunting each other down The film opens with the harrowing transport of thousand of Russian soldiers across the Volga River to Stalingrad The recruits were packed onto steamers, barges, whatever they could find to ferry them across the river All that under a deluge of shells, bombs and explosions By the time Vassili arrives to Stalingrad, the Nazis have a distinct edge, and Soviet morale is at an alltime low Leading the Russians in their seemingly futile defense is Nikita Kruschev, played by Bob Hoskins The Germans, at that time, were overrunning the place and the Russians were in an appalling state It was the most awful battle of the war Joseph Fiennes plays Danilov, an idealistic Russian officer who passionately speaks about his belief in getting the troops to turn the grave situation in Stalingrad around He finds the perfect inspiration in Vassili Rachel Weisz plays a young woman who volunteers to help in the war effort Shes literally protecting the people she grew up with When she meets Vassili, he just has a natural intelligence, a natural instinct Jude Law is remarkable as the young sharpshooter Vassili Zaitsev who conveyed both humanity and intensity Theres such a fierce intelligence and liveliness in his eyes He can also be very quiet and internal Vassili found the complexity within the silence and stillness In fact to be a sniper is very much about a man of action through stillness Vassili represented the ultimate hero, the symbol of someone who could instill hope and belief in victory amongst the troops, because his skills as a sniper were unparalleled Ed Harris played Major Konig, the German sharpshooter sent to hunt down Vassili He knows that Vassili was picking off German officers with some regularity, and was becoming a folk hero for the Russian soldiers as well as the Russian populace... He decided to eliminate him The casting of Ed Harris opposite Jude Law resulted in a striking visual link between their characters They both have these unbelievably penetrating blue eyes And director Jean Jacques Annaud began to see the duel through their eyes And one of the first shots of Ed Harris was a closeup of his blue eyes Annaud painted the tensions very clearly and concentrated purely on the eyes of the Jude Law and Harris and, of course, on their rifles and how they were hidden and what they were doing Basically, the core of his camera is the duel of their eyes, duel of men, duel of snipers, therefore a confrontation of people that scan the surrounding buildings, and try to decipher what they see",False
"Denzel Washington, With One Of The Best Films Of 2016Denzel Washington is clearly one of the best actors we have ever had, African American or otherwise. Whether it has been in serious, soberminded films like GLORY, MALCOLM X, and COURAGE UNDER FIRE, or explosive action films like CRIMSON TIDE, MAN ON FIRE, and UNSTOPPABLE, Washington has given all of himself, and then some. And then, like more than a few great actors, he also itched to get behind, as well as in front of, the camera as a director, which he did in 2002 with ANTWONE FISHER, and again in 2007 with THE GREAT DEBATERS. He does double duty again for one of the most insightful and true films of 2016, FENCES.Scripted by noted playwright August Wilson from his own Pulitzer Prizewinning play, FENCES stars Washington as an average Joetype sanitation worker in late 1950s Pittsburgh dealing with the world at large. He had been a baseball player once before World War II, but it never amounted to much; and when one of his sons (Jovan Adepo) wants to get into football while going to college, Washington tries to steer him away, managing only to alienate his son further than he already is. Washington does have a good friend in Mr. Bono (Stephen Henderson), but he is still troubled by a dark park of himself, one that threatens the eighteenyear marriage between him and his wife Rose (Viola Davis).Adapting stage plays to the screen is not exactly the easiest thing in the world to do, because what works on a stage needs a great deal to transfer it to a movie, and a real, breathing set. Fortunately, Washington found a way of making it happen by filming in a part of Pittsburgh that seems not to have changed all that much from the way it must have looked in the actual time that FENCES is set. Wilsons stage play and screenplay are full of language and slang that is very right for the times, and, yes, this does include a profuse use of the N word. But a certain amount of uncomfortable language is what is necessary for a story like this, especially given that it involves not only Washington on both sides of the camera, but also another hugely superb performance by Davis as his wife, who manages to somehow stand by her man despite the horrible secret he reveals near the end. Equally fine in supporting roles are Adepo and Henderson, as well as Mykelti Williamson as a former war buddy of his whose mind isnt right because of a severe head wound suffered in the war, and Russell Hornsby as Washingtons son by an earlier marriage who constantly comes to his dad on payday for tendollar loans.Though it is an African American cast and story, FENCES works because it feels universal, and it is a story that could happen in any family, regardless of skin color or ethnicity. Washington and Wilson (who passed away in 2005, and thus never saw FENCES make it to the big screen) make this very clear but in a nonheavyhanded way, and with dialogue scenes that are often long but never dull, earning it justifiable and favorable comparisons to Arthur Millers classic Death Of A Salesman.All of these elements make FENCES easily one of the best films of 2016, and a surefire winner likely to be regarded as a classic in a very short time.",False

"Lighthearted but Lame Comedy In this debut feature of the writing team of Anderson and Owen Wilson, friends go on a crime spree. This started as a short and it does feel like too little material stretched too thin. Many good comedies are quirky. Quirky can be good. Quirky can be funny. Quirky doesnt work if it has to work by itself. Its obvious from the situations and the characters that this is meant to be a comedy, but theres hardly a chuckle to be had here. Its quirk without humor. At least the actors are trying hard. Whatever his failings as a writer, Owen Wilson brings a lot of energy to his role, and brother Luke is likable here, but its not enough. Its lighthearted, but its also lame.",False
"A comic book film thats not afraid to BE a comic book film I am astonished looking at the reviews Im reading here reviewing this movie. hm, more like bashing it. Ive never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan dark knight movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed superhero movies take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but theres only so far you can go with trying to legitimize a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, thats the dumbest thing ever.So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40s and 50s comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as twoface, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the sonar suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously.Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film thats not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The complaints that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, batnipples! and neon!, when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman films used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kids as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.",False

"Superb film  Believable acting  Well written  Severely underrated I seriously do not understand the utter hate toward this film by critics when writing their reviews. Historically inaccurate or Just another love story or boring!... If you want to see a film that is totally historically accurate, watch a documentary for heavens sake. This movie goes way out of proportion to what really happened that day in Pearl Harbor, but it is a MOVIE! Get over it. Its not supposed to be real. The film as a whole is brilliantly written; its not too soppy with the romance and not too over the top with pure action. People are saying that its just too much shoot em up and too many explosions. Well, I got news for you... Theyre at war! Bombs will go off and guns will be fired from all places possible. If you want to see a movie thats not so explosive, watch Twilight. To me personally, character development is very important in a movie and I believe Pearl Harbor succeeded with this. I grew attached to individuals and felt vulnerable as a member of the audience at the best of times. Absolutely superb watch, and Id highly recommend it! If youre offended by a film not being entirely accurate, steer clear and stick to your documentaries. 9/10! Excellent!",False
"A little gem of a movie about goals and personal growth Wild has a really intriguing premise, the idea of a solo hike does it for me but I was wary that the movie lasted over 100min. What could possibly be entertaining about a women hiking alone from the Mexican border to the Canadian Border? As it turns out quite a lot.At first, its hard to understand Cheryl, she definitely does not strike you as a someone who could do this. She bit off more than she can shew, its clearly naive of her. But as Cheryl is struggling on her hike flashbacks of her life before the Pacific Crest Trails are peppered throughout the movie and like anyone youre getting to know she starts to make sense. You get to understand what shes been through, who she is, and what motivated her to do this. Its a challenge that she brought on herself for herself, something she needed.And just like that a 115 minutes passes, during which you were taken on physical and soul searching journey with amazing landscapes, and a flawed but strong woman. Reese Witherspoon carries that film beautifully, she layered her performance with sensibility and a quiet strength that suited the character. I didnt totally relate to Cheryl but I wasnt completely impervious to her ordeal, I also have dreams and lifegoals to achieve.On a side note, it was recently pointed out to me I had never seen Wild as the female lead version of Into The Wild. Ive never finished Sean Penn & Emile Hirshs hiking movie but from what I remember Into The Wild was much more wild and raw the dude wasnt on a hiking trail but in the wilderness. These two movies only compare in the drives these two characters have to undertake their journey.Wild is a beautiful movie about personal growth and living in ones truth. @wornoutspines",True
"Mesmerizing Performance in Complex, Contradictory Film Like the nonfiction novel and the Richard Brooks film that was made from it, In Cold Blood, Capote focuses on and sympathizes with two killers at the expense of the four murdered members of the Clutter family. Once the viewer gets beyond this sticking point, however, all three works are outstanding, unforgettable experiences. Unlike the book and the original movie, Capote does explore the contradictory feelings that author Truman Capote wrestles with as he researches and writes In Cold Blood. His feelings for Perry Smith, the more sensitive of the two killers, are particularly problematic as Capote becomes emotionally close to Smith and helps the men with legal aide that postpones the executions, while at the same time Capote cannot finish his book until Smith and Hickcock are hanged. Praise for Philip Seymour Hoffmans uncanny performance as Truman Capote cannot be overstated and, come awards time, if he does not collect enough accolades to fill his mantel, indictments for film critics and Academy voters would be in order. Hoffman not only captures the mannerisms and voice of Capote, he inhabits the mans soul and expresses his feelings and emotions without histrionics or the type of caricature that mimics often have made of the notoriously fey writer in the past.Fortunately, Hoffmans performance is only the jewel in a gilded crown of fine writing, excellent direction, and solid supporting performances. Capote will send viewers back to their bookshelves to reread the book and to their video libraries to review the 1967 film. Considering the time that Capote spent with the two convicted murderers, questions arise as to why the Richard Brooks film did not have Truman Capote as a character, but rather presented a bland, nameless investigative writer, who wanders through the proceedings without much purpose. The film is so good and so intriguing that questions such as that, and what happened to the writer that Capote lived with? and did Harper Lee write anything beyond To Kill a Mockingbird? and did Capotes presence at the execution lead to his alcoholism, his lack of further writing, and eventually his death, and other questions will send viewers to Google as soon as they get home. Capote is an outstanding film and possibly the first of the year to be assured of a place on the 10 Best lists for 2005.",True
"Fritz Langs (sound) masterpiece a taut and quintessentially suspenseful story, and Lorre The first time I saw M, by Fritz Lang, I almost didnt know what to make of it. I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances, the staging of the scenes, the locations, and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances. Then I saw it again, and a third time, and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany its a powerful statement about protecting our children (if youre looking at it as a message movie), but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven. Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements, and have such unconventionality of the times. Boiling down to this, M is about a child Killer  the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role  who snatches children when their parents dont watch, and continues on until an investigation goes underway. But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld, they know something is up, that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be, so they join in the hunt. This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thriller.On the first viewing I just went straight for the story, which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy. But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy, and indeed fullon artistry, of Langs camera. He puts it in unusual places at times, and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene (this is, by the way, a precursor to filmnoir, which Lang later became an important director in the 40s and 50s). On top of this, there is a very modern sense of style in the editing I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise. One is where the cops (I think it was the cops) have an argument about the investigation two of them get into a shouting match, and we get medium closeups of them going back and forth. This is done quickly, with a kind of intensity that isnt even captured in todays thrillers. There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house, where Lang cuts around constantly, heightening the tension between the predators (the criminals) and the prey (Lorre), until its almost too much to take.The disturbing aspects of the story, of child abduction and murder, have become benchmarks of a number of todays thrillers, where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows, in cat & mouse style. This doesnt happen here, and because of it by the time we get to the final scene, with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I cant help it speech, it becomes something poetic, tragic, frightening. Lang doesnt leave his message so simplistically, he makes sure we know Lorres side too, however twisted it has become, and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these presentday thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two. There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture, ultimately causing the two to never work together again. But nevertheless, out of this comes a towering performance of a small, wildeyed criminal in the midst of an extremely welltold and unpredictable mystery story. In short, if you dont know what youre in for when you hear that whistle, those several infamous notes, you may not at all.",False
"Speechless: One of the Alltime Great Films Theres no real reason to critique this film because its as close to perfect as any movie can get. Plus, it has been reviewed over 500 times on this site alone.One important aspect of this film, which is overlooked in practically every online review that Ive read, is Wes Andersons nod to the world of J.D. Salinger. The parallels between Holden Caulfield and Max are numerous, and when considered in light of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (with its scenes at the museum and the b.b. gun battles), the canon of Wes Anderson is one that has been greatly colored by the imagination of J.D. Salinger. From Maxs red hat to his expulsion, the film touches on many ideas from THE CATCHER IN THE RYE. Thematically, the works are quite similar and share an idiosyncratic mood.The other great influence on Wes Anderson, which is even more obvious to any student of film, is the work of Hal Ashby. In particular, the symmetry of Hal Ashbys shots in films like HAROLD AND MAUDE and BEING THERE. Watch RUSHMORE followed by HAROLD AND MAUDE followed by ROYAL TENENBAUMS followed by BEING THERE and youll completely understand this sentiment.Where will THE LIFE AQUATIC fit into this equation?!?!?",True
"Slow, so slow If youve seen Drive, then you should know that this movie is nothing like it, except perhaps in the fact that they are both beautifully shot. Drive had a pretty brisk pace, good dialogue, a plot that went somewhere, and a likable character.Only God Forgives had none of that. This is a movie which moves along at a snails pace, and even at a runtime of 90 minutes, it feels like many hours go by before even a single thing happens. Even the characters move and turn slowly.The plot, such as it is, you would probably find worth watching, but Nicolas Winding Refn peppers it with pseudodream sequences and many pointless scenes that drag on for ever, so that the plot becomes hard to stay interested in.Now, some things you might care about.The acting. Ryan Gosling, of whom I was a fan in his earlier days, plays the same character from Drive, except that here he is indeed even more emotionless. He speaks about 5 lines during the whole movie, and has fewer different facial expressions. Kristin Scott Thomas is very good, although she feels underused. She is definitely the strong point of this movie. Vithaya Pansringarm, who plays a prominent role in the movie, is as expressionless as Gosling, although he is somewhat better, in my opinion.Action scenes do exist, and they do resemble those from Drive, in that they are very matteroffactly and visceral. Here, Winding Refn has really indulged in a lot of gratuitous gore, although overall, I found the action scenes quite entertaining. One particular one showcases Byron Gibsons acting talents, and it is particularly (and hilariously) cringeworthy.All the characters in this movie are unlikable. It is extremely difficult to get yourself to care for any of them, including Goslings, who is arguably the protagonist here.Aside from Scott Thomas acting, the only other redeeming quality of this film is the excellent way in which most scenes are set up and shot. The sets, the camera movement, the placement of the actors, all of these make up for some truly gorgeous shots.Overall, sad as I am to say it, I cannot recommend seeing Only God Forgives.",True
"Unforgettable This is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. The first time I saw it in 1983, my dad took me to see it with my older cousin, who laughed hysterically throughout the film, then said afterwards how much he hated it. That was a memorable moment, but the film itself also made a very large impression on me.  Despite the title, it is anything but a comedy, save for some amusing moments that could pass for dark comedy.The story involves a 34 year old nerd (Robert De Niro) who wants badly to be a standup comedian, but his only method of trying to attain this goal is by essentially stalking a popular talk show host played by Jerry Lewis.  The performances are amazing, of course De Niro can never fail at playing someone offbeat and deranged.  Jerry Lewis is very good as the talk show host, and Sandra Bernhard is also well cast as a fellow stalker.  The film is a tough watch as its tense and uncomfortable throughout, yet entertaining and intruiging enough so it never crosses the line into unbearable, which I imagine must have been exactly what filmmaker Scorcese was going for. Overall, the film is a combination of disturbing, entertaining, and unforgettable.  Whats more, it holds up extremely well seventeen years later, although it initially did not do well at the box office. Score: 9/10",False
"A valuable, sensitive and brilliant Australian thriller.What struck me the most about Lantana was not the welllaid plot, more the thoroughly realistic characters and performances. The classic mystery thread was really only the setting for the several different relationships and couples featured in the film.But having said that, the story itself was gutsy and twisting to keep you guessing till the end, all without the need for nonessential narrative or the need to keep spelling things out. The questions were all answered so far as the story was concerned, but because of the complexity and realism in all the principle characters, i still left the cinema rolling plenty of the emotional issues through my mind for hours after.La Paglia was fantastic. His character, though shown as an adulterer from the very beginning, captured so many of the current male indentities with great subtlety instead of a stereotyped hug session  which most recent films dealing with the subject matter inevitably lead to. He so easily showed the internal conflicts which most normal Australian men deal with daytoday while still keeping up the brave face we all do.I also enjoyed the quirky way the relatively small number of characters were all drawn together by fairly consequential links, and without a huge big statement of it in the end  no matter how many people there are on the planet, it still amazes me how small and incestual problemcircles end up becoming :)This film has the potential to appeal to so many different audiences  works as a mystery, copdrama, chick flick, and to anyone who could ever relate to the feel of Australia, which the film captures perfectly through great ambient audio and naturallooking lighting.Well written, directed, photographed and cast give this one an easy full marks.",False
"Musical of the decade Mad Max: Fury Road sees veteran maestro director George Miller return to the Mad Max franchise after a 30 year hiatus.Fury Road is a hallmark in action films. Millers postapocalyptic future provides an impeccable backdrop for the crescendo of mayhem present in this movie. From the first scene to the last, there is plenty of spectacular action, vehicular and human. The cinematography is lush throughout. From the opening shot of the lizard being stomped by Max (Tom Hardy) to all the action scenes raging in the desert, the camerawork remains consistently on point. Many iconic shots are to be found in this movie.75% of the movie consists of action; so much that there isnt an action SCENE present. Any action aficionados will have their expectations transcended while common moviegoers will have their satisfaction met too. What is surprising, however, is the emotional heft of the 25% that remains. Much of it is dedicated to the back story of Furiousa (Charlize Theron) who effortlessly delivers an Oscar worthy performance by mixing brawn with emotion for her internally wounded character.Nicholas Hoults Nux, who provides one of the best lines of the film: Its a lovely day! at the midst of a crazy thunderstorm consisting tornadoes consisting cars consisting mad humans. Nux is an interesting character in this interesting world and provides plenty of the action by his well... actions.Finally, Tom Hardys delivers a subtle performance as Mad Max. For a character whose name is slapped largely in the film poster, he receives barely a page of dialogue minus a monologue at the start. Considering the fact that he wears a Banelike (see the parallel) mask throughout much of the film, it is surprising how powerful his performance actually is.One musical masterpiece act in the movie comes in the form of the guy the mask furiously shredding a flamethrowing electric guitar while dangling above a mobile wall of speakers that roars through the desert. Imagine that. When all hell breaks loose only accompanied by that as the background music, epic is truly an understatement as a description.Overall, Mad Max is a gleefully insane symphony of destruction that makes the Avengers seem like misfits and the Fast and Furious crew seem like the Slow and Sweet crew. This action packed masterpiece exhibits no shortage of high voltage, 2,000 horsepower action that also contains of lush cinematography, sufficient character development and a satisfactory plot (that works, cause its 75% action anyways). Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely one of, if not the finest blockbuster of 2015!",True
"A Classic is a Classic There are no accidents here. Next year, in a few weeks, Vertigo will be 60 years old and it will celebrate it on top of the list of The Greatest Films Ever Made overtaking Citizen Kane and many other masterpieces. Why? Maybe when a filmmaker of Hitchcocks greatness taps into his own unconscious and reveals himself. By now we know enough about Hitchcock the man to know he was obsessed in finding that woman wholl look and behave just the way he wants and once he find them, they are destroyed to then embark on a quest to replace or duplicate her. Vera Miles was suppose to be the object of James Stewarts obsession and she opted for motherhood instead. Kim Novak replaced her and her coldness and detachment worked beautifully here. Barbara Bel Geddes the real woman who loves him he doesnt even notice, his focus is in the impossible.The magic touch in Vertigo is truly Bernard Herrmann. Try to see Vertigo without the score. No, dont. This classic is a marriage of images and music. A thriller with an uncomfortable truth at its very center. A personal truth from its filmmaker. I dont know if Vertigo will still be the number 1 in the list a hundred years from now, I will never know but I suspect that it will always be among the top.",True
"Limitless I have to say that this movie panders to my particular taste, which is to say it has a well crafted story for our times, good acting and just the right blend of New York atmosphere mixed with a scifi feel. The other main issue is drugs. I personally have partook in the search for an intelligence enhancing substance and it was quite believable to watch Bradley Cooper transform from a bohemianslob to a brainiacoveracheiver. The characters were well written and thoughtout. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current scifi films.The tension was akin to any good crime drama but the plot kept it teasingly interesting. Why didnt I hear of this book? Anyways, Eddie(Bradley Cooper) is trying to meet a deadline after breaking it off with the love of his life(Abbie Cornish),and is on a downward spiral. He runs into an exbrotherinlaw who appears to be a druggie, but is actually involved in designer drug production, and is ensnared in a plot that leads him from the Russian Mafia to Wall Street. The science behind this movie is very believable and I applaud the producers for being brave enough to bringing it to the screen",True
"It will knock your blue suede shoes off!A true Elvis fan will appreciate the solid and outstanding effort by Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He was a natural choice for this project. Aside from the strong resemblance, he also found a way to speak and move like him. He doesnt overdo the accent or the moves. The supporting cast deserves a lot of credit as well, especially Camryns portrayal of Gladys Presley. The story is very well written and flows nicely.

You will hear the original master recordings as Jonathan performs and he stays true to the tone of the song. Without a doubt this miniseries will keep you captivated.",True
"Gretchen Mol is Bettie Page I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by HBO to be shown on their cable network sometime this year. This movie presents Page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and B&D stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50s pinup icon. This film is supposedly based on the book The Real Bettie Page by Richard Foster. Its shot in black and white for that 1950s nostalgia feel. I have the book called Bettie Page The Life of a Pinup Legend that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of Page and I must say that this movie reproduces on film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of those famous photos very accurately. Mol herself with the Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only does she have the Bettie Page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect. And her body is as close to a replica of Pages as possible. Terrific casting. The story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better. But this is a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it a 7.0 of a scale of 10 and recommend its viewing when it comes on TV.",False
"Its your name  use it As a boxing movie Creed packs a heavyweight punch.Sylvester Stallone (as the films producer) has covered a lot of miles with his Rocky legend, most recently with his 2006 Rocky Balboa. As such I had thought there was little milk left in the cash cow, but Creed proves me wrong. This time, with Stallones advancing years, he wisely doesnt stretch credibility by having Rocky Balboa as the center of the pugilism, but hands the baton to young contender Adonis (Donnie) Creed (Michael B Jordan). Adonis is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Rockys protagonist and later close friend in the first four Rocky films.Donnie is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks with a big chip on his shoulder and a reputation for finding trouble with his fists. Brought back from the brink by Apollos wife (a touching performance by Phylicia Rashad) Donnie cant escape his family legacy and seeks Balboas help to make it in the ring, using his own adopted name. Balboas help leads to a number of traditionally brutal Rockystyle encounters in the ring. I must admit I dont normally go for boxing films like this, but this is extremely well done. All of the boxing training is gritty and believable and the actual bouts, particularly the classic finale, is suitably thrilling and a technical masterpiece of camerawork (hats off to cinematographer Maryse Alberti, who also filmed The Wrestler so is no stranger to the ring). A real surprise is just how good Stallone is in the role. There are scenes where Stallone really has to act – particularly an emotional lockerroom scene when Rocky faces up to his own personal crisis – and any jokes about Sylvester Expendables Stallones acting abilities are forgotten. Michael B Jordan is also a great find and a name to watch. He has to cover a wide range during the film and succeeds admirably.Tessa Thompson, impressive in last years Selma, makes a similarly positive impression here playing the love interest in the form of songstress Bianca, with a difficult future ahead of her.Creed is a love letter to the old Rocky films, and – with this quality, and likely success – the start of a whole new generation of films seems probable. The respect it shows to the originals is characterized by a moving tribute to the classic Philadelphia steps scene that brings a genuine lump to the throat. That being said, the film is a lot more street for a new generation, with a soundtrack (by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson) that mixes rap and hiphop with more classic orchestral elements. Without outright plagiarism of Bill Contis classic score, Göransson subtly weaves in some of Contis themes, notably Adrians theme, as well as coming up with his own Fly Now equivalent musical highpoint.Impressive direction is by Ryan Cooglar in only his second feature film (after Fruitvale Station, also with Michael B Jordan). Cooglar also wrote the story and cowrote the script. Without any spoilers, the story is delightfully un Hollywood by being unpredictable in where it goes. However, an area for criticism is that it took a few easy shortcuts in places: a particular change of heart in the film is way to glib and quick.Finally, i would love to watch this film in a cinema in Liverpool, when the hallowed turf for a bout is revealed as being Evertons ground, Goodison Park.! Generations of Liverpool FC fans will be turning in their graves and I predict that cinemas in the city could become scenes of the worst hand to hand combat since the finale of Kingsman!

"Not as funny as it tries to be Who doesnt like witty, lovable criminals, who out wit every copper and other rival criminals in a heartbeat? Thats a crime movie genre, which actually appeals to me: smart dialogs, funny action and so on.So, in Ordinary Decent Criminal we have one of the greatest living actors, Kevin Spacey, who is playing Irish mobster named Michael Lynch, and hes just such a fellow I described. Theres also Colin Farrell in a small role as one of the thugs in Michaels gang. Actually rather good acting all around from all of the actors and thats the only reason this movie stays afloat, because the script is not that funny as it tries to be.Sure, it has couple of good laughs in it, but most of the jokes feel little forced.Direction is pretty decent, not worst thing ever directed, but certainly not the greatest crime movie either.Good for couple of laughs.",True
"My favorite film of all time I realize thats not saying its the best ever made, but it certainly marked me so much as to regard it as my alltime fave. The movie reminisces of Elia Kazans Dean movies, and The Wild One starring Marlon Brando. Just as those movies (and much better done, IMHO), Rumble Fish is about violence as a consequence of uncomprehension; loneliness; and family relations in a sordid, black and white environment. Not even this choice is random, as its B&W filming (and somewhat deficient sound quality) is yet another commentary on life as seen through the eyes of its characters  and author. Every scene in this movie brings a realization, though some of the dialogues are indeed a bit naive when seen after its time. And here I could engage in a debate on naiveté vs. savvy, and whether an innocent view of life really means less message depth (or whether a jaded outlook really guarantees understanding), but I digress. The point is, Im a 27year old man and I still cry every time I see this movie. The first time I saw Rumble Fish, I thought I identified with the Motorcycle boy and his alienation from the world he was put in. After a few more times, I realized more and more that I was Rusty James  That, to an extent, EVERY man is a little Rusty James; trying to live up to a hero image, and helplessly watching as your ideal slips past your reach and lets himself be killed, without you ever understanding anything until its too late... or is it? Where Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis speak to the hero we WANT to be, Matt Dillon speaks to the MEN who want to be that hero, and leads the way out. *sigh* The astounding soundtrack, exquisite photography and perfect takes dont hurt any, either. Buy it, rent it, whatever. See the goddamn movie. It is worth a try (and a much, much better score than 6.7).",False
"A beautifully crafted film I have seen a couple of good reviews of Me and Orson Welles, so decided to go and see whether they were merited. Im pleased to report that the film certainly impressed me.The film focuses on the rehearsals and opening of the play Caesar starring Orson Welles in 1937. Nominally Zac Efron plays the lead as Richard Samuels who is almost 18 and yearning to become an actor. A chance encounter with Orson Welles outside the Mercury theatre leads to Richard being cast as Lucius. Welles was one of those larger than life characters who had so much talent that they could get away with having a rather inflated ego.This is the first time I have seen Zac Efron on screen and I have got to say he played the role of the star struck teenager very nicely. The character is full of dreams and it certainly resonates long after the film has finished.If Christian Mc Kay does not get a supporting actor Oscar nomination for his Orson Welles portrayal it will be a travesty. He is quite simply superb. Ive always found Claire Danes very engaging and she is also very good in this as are a number of the supporting cast including Ben Chaplin and Zoe Kazan.If you are after traditional blockbuster fare from your movies then you are probably well advised to skip Me and Orson, but if you like an intelligent film that is well scripted, well directed (by Richard Linklater) and well acted then its a must see.",False
"love story or justified infidelity A wonderful love story... thats the way the movie was described to me.After seeing it, I couldnt understand where the love story part came in.All I saw was a woman who was unfaithful to her good husband while he was away for four days.The idea, I guess is that she was dying inside and that her life was empty and devoid of passion.If her marriage was that bad, she had other choices, other than violating her marriage vows.If I sound bitter, it is because this happened to me.This movie/story has a deep meaning for me, because my wife had an affair with a stranger.Now I have to question what love is, or what is meant by people when they talk about true love.Why do people get married? Why do they take vows? I thought that I had found true love, thats why I married my wife and thats why I thought she accepted the idea to be my wife and grow old with me.So, NO...

"Fascinating look at the Sixties.Most of us of a certain age will remember the events in this movie as newspaper headlines. I have no idea how much fictionalisation there is but the film does capture the mood of the time and the sleazy blend of Las Vegas show business, gangsterism and American politics. There is no attempt to get look alikes for the main roles but their personalities are suggested rather cleverly. In the smaller roles I thought Dan O Herlihy was a standout as the evil, conniving Joe Kennedy. The musical numbers are well integrated into the plot and nicely done.",False
"My god.. this was awful I dont want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief description on certain elements of this socalled film.Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward.. not to look at. At least convince us youre an intense guy, Mr. Grey. Plot: 1/10. that wasnt a plot for a normal movie, it was a plot for softcore porn.. which had as terrible acting in it as real porn. Camera work/scenery/etc. 7/10 for what it is.. great camera work i guess and good scenery Romance; 2/10. Ive seen the notebook... thats romance. This is a poor attempt to romance. It tries to tell you theyre madly in love, but its just a weird sexual relationship.Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There is no drama in this softcoreeroticdrama. The deeds 10/10.. they did it. so.. cant give it any lower points than this. Overall, its was horrible acted, plotless, nonromantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to.. softcore.. almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage.. boring sh*t. on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. thats one of the best action movies ive seen in a while!",False
"Candle in the Wind Marilyn Monroe, the quintessential blonde bombshell, came to Pinewood Studios in 1956 to shoot The Prince and the Showgirl, a light comedy directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. Colin Clark, the third assistant director on the film, was the lucky 23yearold who got to spend a week with her. My Week with Marilyn cinematises his diary.I imagine there arent many characters more difficult to play than Monroe. It must be like playing Elvis. But Im delighted to confirm that Michelle Williams makes the impossible look easy. She has thrown herself into this part and has nailed the portrayal. Aside from the physical resemblance, Williams walks, talks and acts like Monroe. Its too early to say whether shell win the Oscar next year, but a nomination seems a certainty. Williams performance is bolstered by impeccable turns by an enviable roster of the creamiest cream of British talent: Judi Dench, Kenneth Branagh, Zoë Wanamaker, Eddie Redmayne and Emma Watson. Especial mention must go to Branagh whose Olivier is impeccable. He accurately displays the legendary actors sophistication and scurrility, and is bound to receive a supporting Oscar nod. I loved the films playfulness, for instance when Clark takes Monroe on a tour of Eton, followed by skinnydipping in a cold river. The filmmakers do well to capture the craziness of Marilyns world and the feeling of what it was like to be the most famous woman in the world. There are some lovely little touches – like the scene where Clark asks Monroe why she has a picture of Abe Lincoln by her bedside. Her reply, I dont know who my real father was, so why not him?. Eddie Redmayne, who has appeared in some big films (The Good Shepherd, Elizabeth: The Golden Age) is wellcast as Colin Clark. Perhaps its because he looks so much the underdog. He sort of represents every young man who would have killed to be in his shoes. Clark has his eyes set on Monroe but resigns himself to the fact that Emma Watsons character, a costume assistant, is more his match. A weakness in the story, although Im unclear of the veracity, is how underused Watson is and how readily she forgives his liaison with Monroe. Didnt girls have higher standards in those days?Simon Curtis is yet another Englishman who has moved seamlessly from TV to cinema. His film astutely plays down the fact that Colin was brother to the even more famous Alan Clark, a former Conservative MP. Rightly so, I think. This film isnt about the minister or his alsofamous diaries. Im glad the filmmakers didnt sacrifice the films integrity by moulding it to be rated 12A (British certificate) to increase ticket sales. The two or three flashes of flesh are not only welcome, they are vital (Monroe said that the body is meant to be seen). Curtis teases us like Marilyn was famous for doing. But he knows not to go too far by showing us any more than is necessary. In summary, this is a brilliant biopic, as well as a story of what happened when a young man got close to the star he adored. It is bittersweet and evocative of a golden age of Hollywood. I was made to care for Monroe. I felt bad for her when she was exploited. Along with Elton Johns beautiful song, this film has made me understand Norma Jeane Mortenson a little better. Now I see her as more than a sex symbol. She may have been blonde but she wasnt dumb. Dumb blondes dont read James Joyce or marry Arthur Miller, or come out with some of the wittiest lines a person can utter. She was like all of us, really: a human being.www.moseleyb13.com",False
"Star Wars: An Incredible Beginning When I was a small kid, I used to wonder what the Star Wars universe was all about. Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi Knights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I watched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George Lucas, the creator of the popular scifi saga itself, was trying to accomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And now, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his entire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws. The evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet of Naboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch the two Jedi Knights, Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation Battleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for our heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight facetoface with thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the annoying yet kindhearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful Queen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her makeup).  Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is believed to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a cool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match until his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a Naboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!). You need to see the rest of the film if you havent watched one yet. Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I especially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the wondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To heighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during the climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The Phantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak  (gee, I wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters arent well developed.  Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will be a major improvement by the time Episode II is released.",False
"Unpredictable,exciting,full of mystery and horror psychological thriller For a start,i would like to say that this film is worth seeing.It is one of the best psychological thrillers that exist so i highly recommend to those who like this kind of movies.The plot was very nice,the twist also and the cast outstanding.Cusack,Liotta,Peet and Hawkes did their best and the result was excellent.I liked a lot the flashbacks that were made mostly in the beginning. Furthermore,the idea of the whole film was terrific.On the other hand,speaking frankly there was an excessive gore and emphasis on the murders that didnt impress me;a big part of the movie was dedicated to murders.Another thing that i didnt like was the continuous rain that made me feel tired,seeing again again the storm. Moreover,what i liked mostcontrary to many people was the end of the movie.It was unpredictable and,besides that,it is one of the few thrillers that you cannot find out the end easily.It was very interesting and made me sit tight on my couch .If you dont pay attention for a while you will get lost. I should not forget to refer to the hot presence of Peer that embellished the movie apart from her casting abilities. Lastly,you should make sure that you will be 100% concentrated on the film in order to understand what is happening cause i regard it as one of the most difficult movies to understand.It is certain that this film will dominate you with mystery and in parallel make you think a lot of things that will be predicted wrong in the end. I would give 9 at least out of 10 to Identity.",False
"Inventive, bleak romance drama has power A real stimulatingly offbeat exhibition from Lynch is the dark and wild backdrop of a romantically engaged traveling pair: Sailor who is on parole after committing a brutal murder, and Lula whose mother demands her to return from a spoiled trip to Texas with help from a detective. Its a twisted, artsy journey that is often repulsive and long to boot (and certainly not for the squeamish!), but fares inventive at a certain degree and boasts some of the strongest performances ever worked on a Lynch film, perhaps even in 1990. Cages concert act and the magically rendered semiending are two classic acclaims put together in this moving cinematic collage. RATING: * * *",False
"highly underrated, often overlooked When you ask someone to name the best movies to come out of the earlymid 90s, not many people would mention this movie. Thats too bad.It isnt American Beauty deep, but the film presents real human emotions through the surreal notion of vampires. Cinematography, set design, and score are top notch. It doesnt look dated at all, particularly in this day in age of CG, blue screen galore.The acting....i hate to admit, because im not by any means a brad pitt or tom cruise fan....is pretty darn good. This was the first film I saw tom cruise in and thought (gee...the pretty boy can act), the other coming to mind being Magnolia. Brad Pitt isnt as great, but holds his own and its a quiet, somber Brad Pitt, which is a good change to the normally twitchy, overthe top characters he portrays (fight club, 12 monkeys, oceans 11....even se7en to a certain extent). and of course.....kirsten dunst....whos best role in her career is this film.I havent read the book, so i am writing purely on the film. Apparent by the other reviews here, there are people who really like this movie. Its a shame that more people havent given this movie a chance.",False
"A pretty engaging story with a moral message attached to it.Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson star as couple David and Diana Murphy, who are financially in trouble and in danger of losing their dream home. While on a trip to Las Vegas, they meet billionaire John Gage (Robert Redford), who offers them 1 million dollars in exchange for a onenight stand with Diana.This film was actually pretty good I thought  it kept me engaged and kept me wondering how the unpredictable plot would unfold at the end. The plot offers a moral message of the limits money can buy, and the old cliché that money really couldnt buy love. The acting also wasnt bad. Harrelson gave a thoughtful performance of a husband in financial and relationship troubles who strives to overcome his woes and pick up the pieces to move forward; Redford gave an eloquent portrayal of the invincible, but heartfelt billionaire; and Moore exhibited complexity and vulnerability in her character as she faces the choices she has to make between the two men.I have to admit the movie is mindboggling at certain points, I mean, the thought of seeing a marriage torn apart of an outofthisworld proposal, and the implications that resulted from it. And, there are some failed attempts at humor, at the expense of Oliver Platts character. But overall, the movie has something we can all learn from and is, again, a pretty engaging story.Grade B",False
"Sensational Ive just seen a screening of The Sapphires and have to say that its one of the best mainstream films Ive seen in a long time. It was exhilarating: making me cry, laugh and want to dance. Over the years, there have been some amazing films of and about Aboriginal Australia. One of the very best being  Warwick Thorntons heart breaking Sampson And Delilah.  Some people will belittle The Sapphires for not being similarly heavy but this film is not that film.  This film, with its Aboriginal writer and director (and cast, cinematographer (the wonderfully talented Warwick Thornton) and choreographer) is another film. It is a celebration of spiritedness and strength, lovingly made and deftly told. It left me with vivid impressions of the lives of the characters and of Australia at that time.  Tremendous chemistry between Chris O Dowd and Deborah Mailman and the rest of the cast drew me in and up, as did the spine tinglingly good soul singing from Jessica  Mauboy.  Newcomers Shari Sebbens and Miranda Tapsell were great too. I cant believe that this was Wayne Blairs first feature. Good on you Goalpost  for bringing an important script to (hopefully) a wide audience and doing it with such flair.",False
Probably the best School shooting movie ever made This is my favorite movie about school shooting. Its interesting from the beginning to the end. All actors did a great job. The plot is very original. Not like all other school shooting movies like Elephantor Zero day this one has a deeper meaning. It is also revealing. It proofs that hate isnt the best way to deal our problems. Its also teach us to forgive people their mistakes and to help them to come back to a normal life. The movie is very intense and sometimes even shocking so it will keep your attention until the last minute. I think everybody should see this movie. Rarely they make a movie which would be interesting and revealing at the same time. So if you are looking for a good school shooting movie  this is it.,True
"Bring me the body of Melquiades Estrada The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada(2005) ****Tommy Lee Jones steps up to the plate and takes a big first swing with Three Burials. This is a movie that captures the old Peckinpahesquire style of the rugged west and combines wonderfully with Guillermo Arriagas moody and alienated script. This is a film that could have took a political mood and dealt with the issues of border security and the like, but it smartly refrains from doing so and instead focuses sharply on the heart of society itself  people. Tommy Lee Jones plays Pete, a rancher who has few friends with his closest friends being a woman from town, and a man from Mexico. The woman is the wife of a local diner owner, Rachael (Melissa Leo). She also happens to be extremely bored and engages in extramarital affairs. Pete loves her, but she loves her husband. And possibly the sheriff, and possibly Pete. The other emotional connection in Petes life, the Mexican, is Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo), an illegal immigrant who finds work and friendship with Pete. Pete loves him like a son, or a brother, or friend, or a combination of all three. Barry Pepper plays Mike, the new border patrolman in town. He is brutal. Perhaps by nature, or not. He is bored; he passes the time sitting outside of his jeep looking at dirty mags. His wife, Lou Ann (January Jones), is also bored. She feels isolated and separated from her husband. She spends her time at the local diner and befriends Rachael. While she sits at home, her husband, the rookie border patrolman, makes a stupid mistake and tries in vain to hide it. The whole town is bored, even the police and the border guards. They find out, the police find out, and in a small town people talk, but more importantly people listen because they have nothing else to do. Pete finds out about Mikes mistake and sets out to carry out Mels last wishes and bury him in his home town back in Mexico. The story has its characters and connects them in ways that we dont always suspect they will connect. No one is a cardboard cut out. Even better, no one is simple. Each character is complex and has their own distinct feelings. A major theme is that of alienation. The characters are alienated not only from each other, but from themselves as well. Earlier i stated that he film took the right road and avoids making a blatant political message. The movie still carries a message though. It is a commentary on life and society. The story has parallels to Peckinpahs Bring me the Head of Alfedo Garcia. It has a very Peckinpah style, and features a man who makes a long journey with a dead body. He cares for it and tries to preserve it, even talks to the body sometimes. The film has some great cinematography as well, and the score suits it perfectly. The acting is wonderful, and I have to say that Tommy Lee Jones has rarely ever been better than he is here. Barry Pepper also gives a solid performance. This is Tommy Lee Jones first directing credit in major film and he knocks this one out of the park. Jones clearly has a strong control of his movie and this should go down in history as one of those rare first time wonders. 4/4",False
"Ask her who the hell is Ivan! Who the hell is Ivan?There are some movies that, no matter how good the translation, are just impossible for a particular audience to get. This is why I think most of the American audience wasnt be able to get into WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. After directing the rather weak and disappointing drama/thriller LAW OF DESIRE, Spanish director Pedro Almodovar returned to screens in his full glory with this wonderful Academy Awardnominated screwball comedy.Pepa (Almodovar regular Carmen Maura) works as an actress for TV commercials and dubbing of foreign films. Her lover Ivan (Fernando Guillen), who shares the same job, decides to leave her one day for unknown reasons, leading Pepa to assume he left with his wife Lucia (Julieta Serrano), who was recently released from the mental hospital. But after a while, Pepa realizes Lucia thinks the exact opposite, and that Ivan left for an unknown third woman. While on her quest to find this third woman, Pepa has to deal with her nervous friend Candela (Maria Barranco) who recently found out her boyfriend is a wanted terrorist and Carlos, (Antonio Banderas) Ivans son whose annoying fiancé ends up getting accidentally knocked off by a rather lethal gazpacho.Going any further with this films plot would be unfair since most of the humor is delivered from its many twists and turns. Almodovar was able to write a script so sharp with so many colorful characters and situations that the entire thing goes down with pure laughter. But is everyone laughing?That brings me to the answer as to why many people didnt find this funny at all. If you dont speak or understand Spanish, (or some other language that comes from Latin) you wont be able to get this film as much as others. There is a reason why so many American comedians are never able to make it overseas: Humor is simply not international. The rumored but thankfully never completed American remake of this would have never worked. The performances for example: To people who understand the language, you can tell when the characters are being ironic, sarcastic, goofy, or serious. I dont think you can do that very well when English is your first language. So the users that have been complaining about flat performances might be already explained.Almodovar has been accused of being a feminist, and this movie might be the main reason. I dont quite agree with that because WOMEN doesnt really leave strong message. If it does, I know few people who would actually care for it because this movie is hilarious. Every single character in these 90 minutes of absurdity gets wellbalanced and get enough amount of time to shine: The MAMBO TAXI driver for example, turns out to be one of the funniest elements. The scenes all by themselves are already OK, but the frequency that they happen make them somehow even funnier. And the firstrate acting gets a big plus in my book. Everyone here is perfect (including a very scary way Almodovar coaches a good performance out of Antonio Banderas) with the true standout being Carmen Maura as overthetop neurotic Pepa. It is a shame this was Mauras last collaboration with Almodovar.But WOMA Ns style is also not to be ignored: Most of the movie is set inside Pepas apartment, which is put to good use. It is an amazing thenfuturisticlooking retro set that with its sitcomlike camp and artificial looking painted backgrounds becomes almost a character itself. Cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaines camera is always up to interesting moves: There is the tracking shot of Pepas feet as she walks in circles waiting for her call, or the reflection take from the answering machine. The work with colors is equally stunning, with the main colors being yellow and blue, and Pepas red dress over coloring the environments around her for most of the time. You could freeze frame almost every interior shot of WOMEN... and stare at it for a while.I cant really recommend this movie enough, as much as hard it is to review comedies. Reviewing a comedy is a tough call since it depends on weather you found the material funny or not. I have seen this over ten times and I always laugh at certain moments which I dont want to spoil. Lets just say the Jehovahs testimony and the TV commercial are the parts that always get me. I certainly did enjoy WOMEN... more than any other comedy I have ever seen.(5/5)",False
"Whether or not youve heard of Miss Simone, you really should give this film a try.Ive got to be up front about this...I dont remember hearing anything about Nina Simone before I watched this film. While she was a very famous jazz performer, her meteoric career all but fizzled by the time I was a very young child. I also am not a particular fan of modern jazz, either. So in some ways, I am not the ideal audience for this wonderful new documentary from Liz Garbus. However, because of my work in the mental health field, the film really resonated with me and I think you should give it a look as well. Apparently, Netflix ALSO thinks you should be watching it, as they send out a mass emailing to many people recommending you see this new filmwhich you now can thanks to their streaming service.Nina was a child prodigy at the piano. However this was back in the 1930s...and she was a tiny black girl growing up in the South. Yet despite the racially charged climate, she had a spark of genius such that despite the times, she was helped by people to help realize her dream of being a musician. However, instead of the concert classical pianist she was trained to be, she sort of accidentally fell into the jazz industry and was soon known at least as much as her singing as her genius at the piano. This led to a lot of financial success in the 1950s and into the 60s and life was looking grand for this lady.So how, then, at the height of her fame did Simones career start to slip? And why did she walk away from this life? This confusing journey about mental illness, to me, is the most interesting part of this documentary. While its not perfect (a lot of her more bizarre behaviors later in life are omitted from the story as well as her second marriage), the film is extremely rare in quality and is extremely well made. Considering that Simone died from cancer over a decade ago, this should have been a very tough film to make. Yet, fortunately, they had recordings and diaries of Simone speaking her mind and explaining her strange journey through life. Garbus also was fortunate to have Simones daughters cooperation as well as her first husband and friendsgiving you amazing access into Simones world as well as into her mental illness that impacted but never destroyed her career. This sort of access alone is more than enough reason to see this film.By the way, if you like this film, also trying watching another great Garbus documentary, Bobby Fischer Against the World. The character in this film is, in many ways, much like Simonewith lots of brilliance as well as lots of personal demons.",True
"Coens display confidence in crafting yet another masterpiece I saw this film at a private preview screening in Pittsburg on 5/16/07. I went with five other friends. The entire group was male, 20 yrs old, and mostly college athletes. I explain the demographic of myself and my companions to reason why I was the only one that came away from the film completely satisfied. The story was fresh and different and I dont think my friends had the capacity to fully enjoy what was going on onscreen. I did. And I am still trying to fully understand what an accomplishment it is. Let me try to explain.The Coens begin the movie with a voiceover against a barren Texas landscape, much the way Blood Simple began. In fact, there are several similarities between the two films, like the auspicious lack of music. A reviewer whose name escapes me once said that all Coen Bro. films look great and sound better. Ill get to sound later but to talk about the look... Other than some CGI animals, which really shocked me in such an otherwise perfect film, each frame is filled with such interesting material that the tone is set perfectly so that as you view a scene, you know whether to wait on a laugh or brace for...A large part of what fills those frames is great performances. Perfectly cast is Tommy Lee Jones. He nails it, the crowd goes wild etc... Thats expected though. Josh Brolin, on a very recent hot streak, has given us two tremendous performances this year and both would have been a Cannes if the superbly talented Tarantino was loyal to his material and friend and kept the masterpiece that was Grindhouse untouched. Brolins performance in that film was spot on with the perfect amount of ham and cheese to set the tone for the whole movie. In this one, he shows he can do just as well playing strait and absorbing into character as he does at crowdpleasing cheesballing it. Kelly Macdonald will have to do something else to prove to me she really isnt the Clara Jean character she portrayed even though I know she is a Scot. Woody Harrelson, who I think gets too much praise sometimes, is at his best here and actually manages not to get blown off the screen (well sorta) by Javier Bordem. Mr. Bordems performance is a force, much like the character he portrays. His Chigurh is a representation of the lunacy of violence that exists in society. There is no negotiations with it, it has always been here and it will always be here. It/he leaves us in shock and terror and all we can do is... ??? The first thing that needs to be said about the sound is that if another film wins an award all year for sound or sound editing, investigations should be held and the judges bank accounts monitored. The sound in this movie is so shockingly good. There is no music (save some comically placed source music)and the movie is all the better for it. People talk about the way the music in Jaws enhanced the tension of what was happening on screen. People should, from here on say that the lack of music and the placement of source sound in No Country for Old Men thrilled more.I am certainly rooting for No Country for Old Men to come away with the hardware from Cannes.",True
"The fat lady sings!A kind of companion piece to THE KINGS SPEECH. After the monarch who couldnt speak publicly we are invited to meet the soprano who should never have sung to an audience. This is the moreorless true story of the 1940s New York socialite who seemingly did not know how monumentally awful her singing was. Florence Foster Jenkins was a Woman of Substance in more than one sense: a megarich heiress, built like a leaking sandbag and possessed of an immense ego.Its a gift of a part, and Meryl Streep goes for it at full throttle, combining elements of Ethel Merman, Hyacinth Bucket and Nellie Melba to stupendous effect. The supporting cast are also given juicy roles to wallow in and, boy, do they wallow! Hugh Grants lightweight shtick works perfectly for Florences second husband, who openly keeps a mistress but dotes like a puppydog on his ailing wife, indulging her musical delusion with a passion that fully matches her own. David Haig plays Florences vocal coach in the manner of a pantomime horse.Simon Helberg steals many a scene as her gay accompanist who finds it hard to keep a straight face but comes to be caught up in the typhoon of Florences enormous selfbelief. There are some delicious cameos among the members of the New York elite who support the fantasy with varying degrees of sincerity. The finale, Florences sellout concert at Carnegie Hall is a comedic if not exactly a musical triumph.This is a slight story, crisply scripted, elegantly photographed and stylishly directed (by Stephen Frears). Streep steams through it like an ocean liner – theres more than a hint of Queen Mary the former first lady as well as Queen Mary the excessively luxurious vessel. Yet another Oscar could easily come her way. In Dustin Hoffmans QUARTET I felt slightly cheated that the principals never actually sang. Here you look forward with a kind of awed dread to the moments when the fat lady sings!",True
"Familiar tale told freshly, honestly, with appealing cast Weve sorta been down this road before: 1960s pop band makes it out of their deadend hometown for Hollywood, but fame and fortune unravel the fun. Still, this picture has remarkable focus, careful period detail, and a lovely cast that rarely (if ever) strikes a false note. If some of the young actors sometimes seem like theyre doing Tom Hanks impersonations, thats okay because director Hanks (himself a costar) seems to know these characters inside and outand he likes them. We in the audience are quick to respond, and even the conventional parts of the movie work because Hanks rides over clichés with verve and enthusiasm and wit. Not a raucous comedy a la I Wanna Hold Your Hand (which is what it looked like to me in the ads), this has its share of subtle moments. There is a meanspirited dig at the Frankie & Annette Beach Party flicks, and the readymade romance at the end is sugarcoated, but That Thing You Do! is immensely likable. It has a huge heart. ***1/2 from ****",False
"A comedydrama with a spoonful of sugar From the studio that brought you Mary Poppins, Disney has released a biopic about the author of the original novels, P.L Travers. Saving Mr. Banks is the story of her battles with Walt Disney, who wants the rights to the film adaptation, in a dramatic comedy that is both witty and sentimental.Mrs. Pamela P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) has been hounded by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and the Disney Corporation for 20 years for the film rights to her book and she has refused constantly. But by 1961, she has run out of money and agrees to go to Los Angeles for two weeks to work with the writing team to see if a deal can be struck. Her conditions are that the film cannot be animated, there are no songs and she has final script approval. Travers quickly clashes with creative team and Walt himself, a man who promised his daughters he would adapt the book.As this is going on Travers reflects on her childhood in rural Australia, with her father (Colin Farrell), a loving man who feeds his daughters imagination, but an alcoholic with probable depression and how these events influenced her writing.Saving Mr. Banks is a film armed with excellent screenplay and a top notch cast. As well as the likes of Thompson, Hanks and Farrell, Saving Mr. Banks also features Bradley Whittaker, Jason Schwartzman, Paul Giamatti, B.J. Novak and Ruth Wilson. They all offer strong performances and have given us very well defined characters. Thompson dominates as Travers, a no nonsense woman with poor social skills and a British Bulldog stubbornness/determination and injects a deadpan humour with the witty lines she was given. Thompson also brings out the emotion, the serious aspects of the character, as the shadows of her past still linger over her.One of the big themes of the film is the writing process, both the individual, personal aspect and the collaborative effect of a film adaptation. Saving Mr. Banks shows that many writers use they personal experience and life and become a part of the author. It is hard for writers to let go and particularly for Travers, as she has so much invested in Mary Poppins, so much of herself in it. Her books allowed her to have some wish fulfilment.The screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, director John Lee Hancock and editor Mark Livoisi worked brilliant to blending the story of Travers butting heads with Disneys creative team and her backstory about her childhood influencing her writing. There are plenty of transitions, allowing Hancock to have some fancy pans. One particular noticeable sequence is when the creative team performs one of the songs and Travers has a flashback. The film slowly reveals how Travers childhood and her father became a part of her writing, used in the books and become a part of the themes of her books and philosophies. This is particularly the case with her parents and their inabilities to cope, both Travers fathers alcoholism and mothers inability to cope with the stress, leading to her theme of responsibility. For a film that is about the writing process, Saving Mr. Banks never really shows about the writing process that Travers goes through, but explores the writing process of adapting a work, from one medium to another.The final theme and a big part of the comedy comes from the clashes of cultures and personalities. Travers is a brash personality with formal, conservative approach and lives a modest lifestyle in London and a rustic life in Australia. This in comparison to the overtly friendly American and their glamour and excess, from the fashion to the food, particularly sweet treats and the hard sell from Disney in Travers hotel room.Saving Mr. Banks has a excellent screenplay, solid direction and balances the comedy dramatic portions extremely well. The film makes sure there is plenty of sentiment, particularly with the score by Thomas Newman. It is a safe film, but still a pleasing experience. It is perfect if you are a fan of Mary Poppins and you will have the songs stuck in your head.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",False
"I Killed My Mother I Killed My Mother is a Canadian film in French with English subtitles. The film focuses on the relationship between a 16 year old named Hubert and his mother Chantale. To say that they do not always get along is an understatement. Yet with all the verbal abuse between one another and the tension, they do still love each other and may soon realize that perhaps they can not live without one another. Chantale was not ready to become a mother and in a lot of ways, still is not, even though her son Hubert is now 16. We see Chantale as ego centric sometimes, but mainly just in her own world and the concerns of Hubert are not always hers and when he tells her something, she soon forgets and in a lot of ways she can have temper tantrums and be just as immature as a child at times when things are not going her way. Hubert is a teenager, which anyone can tell you is one of the most complex and stressful parts of ones life and growing up. Hubert is starting to find love and creativity in what he does, but he often feels that Chantale does not appreciate him, let him have his own space, or even acknowledge that he is there a lot of the time and his feelings, needs and concerns mean little to her, or if they have any significance, she soon forgets them. Hubert is coming to a point in his life where he is hiding quite a bit from his mother and perhaps if they were closer this would not be the case, but it makes it all the more difficult for him. One thing that I really liked about the film was that it does not place blame for the poor state of the relationship solely on Chantale and neither does it place all the responsibility, or fault on Hubert. Like any family that is going to work, or be somewhat functional, it takes the efforts and input from everyone involved to make it work, not just one individual alone. The film is told from Huberts perspective and even he admits that there are things he still loves about his mother and we can see from her body language and the way she acts that deep down she still really cares for him and perhaps the problem is that she has too much other stuff on her mind. The character development and just the handling of the story is fantastically done. It takes a subject most of us would have some insight on in one way or another and gives us different ways of looking at it. At times what we are watching is very unsettling and hard to watch at times, at other times it is very realistic and no matter what type of background, or family you come from, you can not help, but reflect on your own childhood and relationship to your own parent, or guardian. The writing establishing these characters and their own problems, needs and ways of reaching out is pretty realistic and is all the more believable because of fine dialogue and top notch acting. Both, Xavier Dolan (Hubert) and Anne Dorval (Chantale) give fearless performances here going to places with their characters and their psyches and the way they pull it off with energy, sadness, facial and body language is terrific. The script and the films direction which is also from Dolan is at times haunting, poetically beautiful at other times and it always feels so real and like he has captured life through his art. Not an easy thing to do and here he does an amazing job. Dolan wrote, directed and starred in this film at the age of 19 and this film is just as good as a film from a much older or experienced director, writer or actor. This is a terrific debut for him and mark my words because this guy is going places in a big way. I can not wait till I see what he comes out with next. I Killed My Mother has a power that stays with us and leaves us with thoughts and reflections of our own past and what we have just seen on the screen. The film does not give us any easy answers, but instead gives us room and time to digest and think more about what we have seen and I think in some ways this is a life changing film because it had an impact on me and made me look at these type of situations in a different way and I imagine it will have the same affect on other viewers. This is a towering achievement of excellence in every possible way. I Killed My Mother will go down in film books, will be studied in university film classes one day and can have some pretty scholarly people writing about it, just because there is so much here. This is probably the best film I have seen in the theatre for a long time and I could not recommend it enough. A true masterpiece.",False
"Two Men in a Boat I was surprised at how effective this was. You know from the very beginning how it will end. You know because it is a true story that there will be no trendy plot twists. You expect, and find, that the young assistant is built around a cliché, as is Hanssens Catholicism, which oddly ignores the role of Opus Dei in this venture, and focuses on prayer instead of devotion.And there is a formulaic bit about damaging fathers and odd wives. More: theres the project command center that is drawn from movies and not from life. And finally, our hero is told the FB Is biggest secret in an open public place. This would never ever happen, and it is staged this way only to help the pacing of the thing in terms of stagecraft. And that DIA computer room, with the nice clean Craylike machines, is from the same fantasy world as Red Octobers neonlighted missile tubes.But in spite of all this, it works. And especially compared to The Departed, it works, simply, cleanly, deeply. Thats because the filmmaker decided early in the game that he was going to do what the Hong Kong Infernal Affairs did well and others copied: this business of actors playing characters who are actors. In this case, we have two such in the same boat.We have a top information manager at the FBI working for the Russians and acting normal, even when leading the hunt for himself. We have the young under cover guy pretending to be simply a clerk. Each intuits the other is watching. The older man completely wins at the start, with the younger man eventually besting him in artifice. Its a calculation that the filmmaker makes, when deciding not to tell us why our young hero does what he does and where he gets the tools. In an ordinary story, that would hurt, but here it is a wise decision because such explaining would get in the way of the economy of the thing. And it is all about economic connection with us.Its a bit counterintuitive that effective stories sometimes get better by lopping off story elements and information. But it is true. Some students of the Hanssen case believe that Hanssens primary motive was to show his own importance (as a information security planner) by revealing holes in the system that he would have plugged. I wish this film would have worked with that a bit, because this notion of helping the system by hurting is system is both what the story could have been about and the means used to tell the story.Still, a good one.As a historical note, theres a reason folks from the FBI and CIA, even senior ones, cant wander into NSA computing facilities. Hanssen wasnt allowed, probably a good thing at the time. Opus Dei again.Teds Evaluation  3 of 3: Worth watching.",False
"My Own Private Idaho Mike (River Phoenix) has narcolepsy, and whenever he feels superstressed he suffers what I interpret to be attacks of cataplexy, that is, sleep triggered by heightened emotions. His friend, wouldbe lover and fellow male prostitute, Scott (Keanu Reeves), has a rich dad whos going to leave him a hefty sum when he turns 21. These two characters are the main focus of My Own Private Idaho which deals with common and uncommon themes, such as home, sexual identity and love. Van Sant throws in some Shakespearean language plagiarised straight from Henry IV and a nonlinear narrative and youve got one very cute surrealist indie film.The credits to this film are its director and star, River Phoenix, whose understated and moving performance lifts this film above the trash it easily couldve been in another director or actors hands. Van Sant uses symbols to represent emotional states and his use of special effects is limited and effective. There is some really heartfelt dialogue in this movie, especially the muchmentioned campfire scene.This film can be irritating; sometimes the Shakespearean dialogue doesnt work (and its okay to admit that a nearperfect film like this has flaws) and Reeves is sometimes a little stiff.

"I Want Your Best Game Although a lot of this plot is taken from the Richard Widmark rodeo film When the Legends Die, The Color of Money is still a worthy film and a good successor to the early Paul Newman classic, The Hustler.I imagine that players like Paul Newman who create classic characters like Fast Eddie Felson must be bombarded with scripts or story ideas for sequels. Paul Newman is one of the most discriminating of players and up to this point he had only reprised his role in Harper with The Drowning Pool.When he decided to do The Color of Money there was no need to age Newman twenty five years with makeup. Time had done a better job than any makeup man could have done. Time had also honed his acting abilities so that he could realistically recreate one of his classic characters in an older generation.One thing about The Color of Money is that can and does stand independently of The Hustler. You do not have to have seen the earlier film to know whats happening here. Nevertheless in that earlier film, promising new pool player Eddie Felson does not take direction from mobsters who effectively end his career before he gets it firmly on track.Fast forward from 1961 to 1986 and Paul Newman is now a liquor salesman who hangs around poolrooms in tank towns and dreams what might have been. A young kid with a sledgehammer break gets Newmans attention and its Tom Cruise. Hes got a girlfriend, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio with him and the three sort of adopt each other. Its a complicated relationship between all three of them and all three of them manage to convey the many ups and downs of this triangle. Newman teaches Cruise the tricks of the trade including how to tank a game occasionally to bring up the betting odds. In many ways Cruise learns too well and Newman hanging around with him makes him realize just how much hes missed because of the gangland blackball.Reportedly Newman and Cruise got along splendidly during the making of The Color of Money. Their joint interest in auto racing cemented a very good working relationship.Paul Newman was also nominated during the eighties for Absence of Malice and The Verdict which are two of my favorites with him. Unfortunately in the first he was up against Henry Fonda who had been similarly snubbed for years by the Academy and was dying during the Oscar voting. The second time Ben Kingsley portrayal of the title role in the massive blockbuster Gandhi obscured what I think is Newmans finest performance in The Verdict.Though the Oscar was an Oscar for lifetime of work, The Color of Money is a worthy sequel to The Hustler. Martin Scorsese got great performances out of the whole cast. And Paul Newman finally got a matching Oscar to go with the one Joanne Woodward won for The Three Faces of Eve for their mantelpiece.",False
"The Cinema of Abel Ferrara: King of New York.King of New York (1990) was Abel Ferraras return to the his favorite style of film making (the urban street drama). Over the past fifteen years, this movie has achieved a cult status that one would have never imagined. During its initial release on video, this film was a wordofmouth hit. I remembered watching this in high school. Although the movie was never a major box office hit, film found an audience when it was released on tape. But the movies popularity grew even more when rappers made numerous of references to it in music and song.Christopher Walken stars as a crime lord who has done a stint in prison. Upon his release he begins to rebuild his fledging empire through violence and strong arming. Whilst he rotted in prison, his rivals became strong as they gobbled up his business. With time on his side, Frank launches a plan thatll make him KING OF NEW YORK. Can Frank do it by himself? How will the local authorities react to his new found activities? Will his soldiers remain loyal? What will his rivals do? To find out youll just have to watch it!!I found this movie to be very good. Abel Ferrara has found his niche audience and he should cater to it. He has a style that a director like Martin Scorese once had.Highly recommended.",True
The whole movie was like a painting. A work of art.I was fascinated by that movie. Every scene looked like a painting and they perfectly captured Vermeers light . I also liked the historical references to how Vermeer liked to paint young people so he could work on big surfaces of colour and avoid the shading wrinkles give. The music was beautiful and gave off a Dutch feeling of the 17th century as it should have. The time customs that were mentioned are also a great asset.Griet looked so much like Vermeers original painting that I thought in a moment that this was real (but of course it couldnt cause back in 17th century were no cameras around :p).It was a perfect movie for someone interested in art. Other might find it a bit tiring but if you are an art lover you definitely have to watch this.,False
"A good combination of action & comedy2 Guns turned out to be a better film than I expected it to be. I liked the plot and it had plenty of twists and turns. It is quite suspenseful in places and keeps you guessing. It is about a bank robbery (the masks here were quite cool) that goes wrong and the two have to team up to put it right.The acting is very good. Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington were a very good team, they had a good on screen chemistry and I liked how their friendship developed. The supporting cast were also good.The film is a mixture of action and comedy. There are good shoot out scenes and car chases etc. Then there is comedy thrown in for good measure, made even funnier because its silly humour in a serious situation. Mark Wahlbergs character has some memorable funny moments and both do the action scenes very well.Overall it was a good fast paced action film, it had suspense and humour too. A really good mixture. At 1 hour and 35 minutes I felt it was a good length, you got everything you wanted out of it and it wasnt dragged on like some other films would. I enjoyed it from start to finish and would recommend it.8/10.",False
"Unbearably Beautiful  one of the best films ever made One of the most romantic films ever made, it shows the problems of people whose intimacies and personal conflicts are being interrupted by history on the move. I think this film surpasses the novel, which is utterly cynical (although understandably). Even in the last moments of the novel, Teresa is concerned that Tomas is cheating on her. The film also does well by dropping much of Franzs character  he was kind of uninteresting compared to Teresa, Tomas, and Sabina. It also drops such deadweight characters as Teresas mother, Tomas son, and Franzs wife. Also, a ton of different coworkers are combined into a few, so that their characters have time to develop. By concentrating on the three central characters, this film blossoms past what the novel ever achieved (although the novel is arguably more historically important). Philip Kaufman and Jean Claude Carriere also add a couple of beautiful scenes that werent in the novel, including Tomas and Teresas wedding, which is one of the most beautiful scenes in filmdom.",True
"Perfect...Just Perfect.  Do yourselves a favor and watch it but......dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, braindead and pointless. The film is excellent, the acting by both Denzel and Dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. Actually fabulous is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still havent watched your favorite one yet...Trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. The film is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever...just dont miss it",False
"An intriguing and diverse journey In an attempt to give away as little as possible about this film, obviously so that you can enjoy all of the phases as I was able to do, I would like to simply highlight my opinion about this movie. It was a great film and was very entertaining. Id recommend you take a chance and go see this film. Expect some theatrical diversity and in the end it all comes back full circle.I have nothing negative to say. The acting was mature and accurate. Each character was playing a role that suited their own set of talents superbly.Try not to read too many reviews and just go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.",True
"Dont go expecting accuracy!Overall, the movie is entertaining. I thought the acting was good, particularly Scarlett Johanssons. The cinematography and editing leave much to be desired, and the entire movie seems rushed. If you have any knowledge of Tudor history,you will recognize the many inaccuracies, but those did not bother me as much as did the fact that important characters were omitted, undeveloped, or even seemingly forgotten (as in the case of Marys husband, William Carey).There ARE very affecting characters and scenes, but I left the theatre wishing for MORE. The fascinating lives of these people simply cannot be dealt with in a movie that lasts less than two hours.",False
"A movie lovers dream come true.This is a difficult film to write about. For one thing, to describe the plot would be to give away the twists and thus spoil its surprises; but for another, its impossible to take a great work of art and put it into words. That said, here goes:Truth be told, it was the promise of Gael Garcia Bernal (whom Ive loved since Y Tu Mama Tambien) in drag that piqued my interest in seeing Bad Education. The only other Almodovar movie Id seen before this was Talk to Her, which I was on the fence about, but if Gael Garcia Bernal was involved, I was happy to give Almodovar another shot. (Interestingly, Bad Education has given me a new appreciation of Talk to Her. The two films share a lot of themes  false identity and selfcreation, the willful selfdeception and fantasy of falling in love, the spiritualization of aesthetic beauty  not to mention a hypnotic use of music, an indifferent attitude towards women, and a few actors I recognized.)Almodovars genius in both Bad Education and Talk to Her is his ability to set the scene, stringing the audience along, lulling it into a sense of comprehension and security, and then suddenly turning the tables with a twist of such dizzying magnitude that the mind, reeling, forced to give up on trying to understand, must just relax and allow the movie to take over  miraculously, all without leaving the audience feeling manipulated. In Bad Education, he takes this device to breathless, upperatmospherical levels, for with each twist, the film takes on a new genre.It begins as a tender comingofage story, interspersed with boardingschool flashbacks reminiscent of such French fare as Louis Malles Au revoir, les enfants and François Truffauts Largent de pôche, although I sensed a lot of Fellini in the mod outfits, feathery hairstyles, and picturesque bicyclestrewn streets. Probably the most romantic segment of the film, it alludes even to Breakfast at Tiffanys (Henry Mancinis Moon River hasnt been employed so creatively since last years Angels in America). Indeed, the performances are so endearing, the cinematography so warm and luminous, that this segment of Bad Education could easily exist as its own selfcontained movie. I was fully prepared to embrace it and love it as a sincere period romance.But without warning, the film turns itself upside down and becomes an exhilarating metacommentary in the vein of Charlie Kaufmans Adaptation (complete with crocodiles). Romance turns to farce and tragedy to comedy as the selfconsciously cinematic style gives way to the silliness of a moviewithinamovie.Unlike Adaptation, though, Bad Education goes on, and in this way it retains its heart and soul. Further twists are introduced, and the movie metamorphoses into a mystery, a thriller, a dark rainsoaked noir  by the end, I felt as though I had just lived through a hundred years of cinema history, all condensed into less than two rich, glorious hours.So what holds it all together? The answer is Gael Garcia Bernal. He is a true movie star  divinely beautiful, dazzlingly charismatic, with that allimportant aura of mystery  and though he virtually plays five characters as his character transforms along with the film, his strikingly calm bluegreen eyes and sensual mouth provide a steady center for the madness around him. Despite the rumors of his abusive treatment on set at the hands of Almodovar, Garcia Bernal has a dignity (without which Bad Education would collapse under the weight of its own intelligence) that no amount of makeup, wigs, dresses, induced anorexia, or fake Spanish lisping can mask.Bad Education was one of the most intense moviegoing experiences Ive ever had, and if its future doesnt hold critical acclaim and recognition as a classic, then theres no justice in the world.",False
"Not Bad for Goslings Directorial Debut As a freshman director, Ryan Gosling shows promise here. This is a quirky, Arthouse film (of which there arent enough, lately) with Lynchian elements (Blue Velvet; Lost Highway) Some of them work, others dont (Dave singing Cool Water was a bit silly).Casting was OK, with solid performances from Iain De Caestecker,Christina Hendricks, Saoirse Ronan, and the beautiful Eva Longoria in particular. Landyn Stewart is adorable! Where did they get this kid? Matt Smiths performance was appropriately overthetop, and scary. Overall, Id recommend Lost River, because it consistently held my interest, and had a great storyline. I look forward to more Goslingdirected efforts, as I see great potential there. Im rating it a little higher than the average, because Id really urge people to see it, and, as I said earlier, there should be more movies in this peculiar genre.",True
"Life changing film This is arguably one of the best WW2 films I have ever seen. There arent many films that tell the story of the situation outside of Europe and this tells it brilliantly. Collin Firth portrays the emotional struggle of a man plagued by the war extremely well, and I was gripped from start to finish. Ive been to Thailand and this was possibly why I was so affected by the film, but I thought it was extremely touching and thought provoking. The story affected me to the point of tears (as no other film has ever done). There is so much depth and beauty to the film and characters and I think its a shame it hasnt been rated higher.",False
"Some Personal Opinions Why This Film is so Beloved...Possible Spoilers*** First of all, major praise goes to Jang Dong Guns riveting performance. He captured the essence of a nation divided, the immorality of war as your own folks become your enemies, and love for your brother regardless of the situation of the world and/or personal vendetta. The transformation he undergoes and the madness of war he evokes and invokes leaves quite an impact garnering notice.I knew I was in for something as soon as I saw the archaeological dig of a battlefield starting the film as a grandfathers story is slowly drawn out. The flashback sequence between two brothers is heartwarming as you see the elder brother watching over and sacrificing for his younger sibling and the bond that they have. Being an only child, I wish I had a brother like that. Then the war hits and everything turns upside down as the gut wrenching begins.The haunting thing about this movie is that the enemy is your own people and they speak your own language and share the same ancestors and genetics. Whats more you kill your own kin because of circumstance in a situation of kill or be killed. The simmering conflict between the two brothers deserves special attention because it will hit home as the core message of the movie is made by it. The film made me think of what my parents and grandparents lived through.About Saving Private Ryan. To me they were worlds apart in situation, meaning and focus but similar in execution and structure. Just as Saving Private Ryan spoke so resounding to its audience, Taegukgi does the same for its own.",False
"This is a picture of sheer power and beauty Life of Pi is one of the most marvelous theater experiences Ive had all year. Its Oscar for art direction and cinematography should already be locked in. Its a film of incorruptible beauty and deeply satisfying drama which squeezes so much power and emotion out of its audience that they leave feeling riveted at the same time drained. You can bet the films main character feels the exact same way.Our main character is an adult named Piscine Molitor, who goes by the name Pi Patel, and we meet him as an adult (played by Irrfan Khan) who begins telling his long lifestory to a writer planning to adapt it (Rafe Spall). Its a story that tested him as a person in every possible way, and it all goes back to when his parents made the decision to move from India to Canada, and because Pis father was a zookeeper, take many animals such as orangutans, zebras, goats, and tigers with them on an enormous ship across the Pacific Ocean. Before this move, Pi was an optimistic soul, who ventured out as a young boy beyond his comfort zone in his Hindu religion to seek out other walks of faith, specifically Christianity and Islam, which he began following all at once.During the move, a wild, violent storm hits the ocean, flooding the ship and sending Pi, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger named Richard Parker on a lifeboat, leaving behind the several other animals and Pis entirely family. This whole sequence, which lasts around five minutes, feels like the entire movie The Perfect Storm shortened from its original twohour length, only it emphasizes the emotional elements. This is one of the saddest scenes of the year, as we see a teenage Pi (now played by Suraj Sharma) desperately hold onto the lifeboat for dearlife, while being washed away from his mother, father, and siblings and there is absolutely nothing he can do about it. Between you and I, reader, this is one of the most emotionally upsetting scenes (this and the ending of the film) Ive ever sat through in a theater.Now, Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific, with an open sky, four different animals, until they are picked off with only the tiger remaining, and his own will to live. The remainder of the film forgoes the backandforth narrative between adult Pi telling the story to the writer, but remains focused on his own recollection of events on that lifeboat and the acts of bravery he committed to keep him and the tiger alive. While Pi and Richard Parker are sharing the boat, that does not mean they get along. Writer David Magee makes no mistake in illustrating that while they are stranded together, Pi is a human boy and Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger. The beauty of this picture is that it never mistakes that the only common traits between these two souls is that they are stranded together and both are mammals.Life of Pis visuals are astounding. Long shots that hold on the vast emptiness of the Pacific are invigorating because of their wide range of beauty and clarity, sequences of peril and uncertainty are captured through an equally clear, vivid lens, making them all the more real and enthralling, and atmospherically, the picture shows the dangers and the loneliness of the ocean better than any film I have yet to see.Thematically, the picture focuses on predominately on the idea of survival and spirituality, which gratefully helps Pi keep hope and optimism during these gruelingly unforgiving days. One of the most intense and poignant scenes comes when Pi is faced with the task of killing a large fish. He is starving, and becoming skinnier by the day, so he fiercely grabs a fish out of the water and begins hacking at it with a small axe. When the fish is bloody and long dead, he begins to sob tears of joy and sadness; joy because he finally has a decent portion of food, yet sadness in the idea that he has killed a living creature and is about to abandon his vegetarian vow. Its a scene that, once more, clouded my eyes with tears, just like Pis, of joy and sadness. This is a picture of sheer power and beauty. A film that clearly tests its lead actor, Sharma, who is inhabiting his first main role, and a film that will hopefully go on to live with a reputation of one of cinemas supreme achievements. It must be said that in Ang Lees twenty year film career that he has tackled almost every genre in the medium and done so with an extraordinary amount of confidence. His directorial efforts too have not been minor additions to the genre, but true gamechangers if anything. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a martial arts film filled with depth and delight. Hulk was a superhero movie that added so much weight to its characters and relationships, youd think Christopher Nolans modernday Dark Knight franchise was taking notes from it. And Brokeback Mountain was, for the most part, a lively portrayal of two men whove kept their orientation silent for so long that they begin to embrace it by meeting each other out of the blue. Life of Pi offers more of the same grandiose ideas from the brilliant visionaire and its shocking smoothness in terms of filming, placement, and writing is beyond fabulous and wildly consuming because of its clarity. This is one of the best films of the year, and onpar with the depth and cinematography in Samsara, making this year one of the most beautiful.",False
"Another Coen Brothers Classic!!!I recently purchased Barton Fink along with Millers Crossinhg, another Coen Brothers gem.Barton Fink quite simply is a writer who cannot see the forest for the trees. He is so taken with the fact that he is a writer that he cant write. He is so idealistic that he misses fantastic opportunities to become a writer for the ages because he wastes precious time proselytizing. John Goodman perfectly sums up everyones frustration with Barton Fink when after a series of unfortunate occurrences, Barton asks him Why me? to which Johns character answers Because you dont LISTEN! Set in 1930s Hollywood we follow the exploits of a onehit wonder, Barton Fink, who has written a successful Broadway play and is summoned by the powers that be to Hollywood. After much cajoling to take the job from his agent, Barton arrives in Los Angeles determined to become the writer for the common man where he insists true stories live. The trouble with Barton, however, is he does not have time for the common man because he has so romanticized their lot as well as his particular quest in speaking for them.Excellent performances from John Turturo, John Goodman, Judy Davis, John Polito (often overlooked, but his scenes ALWAYS become his!!) and the inimitable Tony Shaloub.I have decided after a slew of Coen Brothers films I currently have in my collection, that any project these guys are involved with deserve more than passing scrutiny.",False
"Hilarious!  I loved this fun, but slightly dark comedy We were happy to have had the chance to see this at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. I loved the cast: Greg Kinear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steve Carrell were ALL marvelous as the dysfunctional family. Little Miss Sunshine refers to a pageant to be held in California (the movie never states where the family lives, but most of the road scenes were definitely in the Phoenix, Arizona area. (added 8/2/06: I know now that the movie is set in New Mexico, for those of you who are interested in that sort of thing!)The story follows little Olive, a normal child, who by a fluke wins her way into the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The family decides they must accompany her in their old VW bus, so a road trip ensues.The final third of the movie, which deals with the actual pageant, is by far the funniest part of the film. It illustrates, with great hilarity, the frightening people who are involved in child pageants. You cant help rooting for Olive, who is refreshingly normal amongst the frighteningly plastic other contestants.(After discovering that I was in the (opposite of loved it) category on IM Db, I changed my subject line, because this was one of the best movies Ive seen all year!! I LOVED IT)This is NOT a movie for children. After reading through some other user comments, I have to say Im dismayed by the amount of people complaining about the F word. This movie is rated R, mostly because of its frequent use of the F word, along with some drug use. If you do 5 minutes of research before you go to a movie, you should educate yourself as to WHY a movie is rated the way it is. If you are offended by swearing, then, if you go to a movie that is rated R because of language, be prepared to be offended! Okay, Im off the soapbox. This is NOT a movie for children.",True
"Like reading a comic book  literally Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who also codirected and wrote the screenplay) Sin City tells three stories of crime, corruption, and redemption set in the fictional town Basin City. The first story details the quest of Marv (Mickey Rourke) who searches town for the man who murdered Goldie (Jamie King), the woman he believes to be his one true love. The second tells of Dwight (Clive Owen) who must cover up the death of a corrupt police officer (Benicio Del Toro) in order to avoid a war between the cops, and the girls of old town, led by Gail. (Rosiaro Dawson) The final story shows Hartigan, (Bruce Willis) a beat up retired cop framed for a crime he didnt commit, trying to save the life of a girl whose life he saved at a young age, who grew up to become a stripper, (Jessica Alba) while all the while being tracked by a mysterious stranger with a grotesque appearance. (Nick Stahl)Its a churning vat of old fashioned pulp style stories, each one more dark and edgy then the last. And yet, Sin City itself is morbidly fascinating; if you dont mind delving through the haze of sleaze, violence and corruption youll find a really compelling story underneath the hard exterior. Sin City exudes the essence of classic film noir, except combined with overthetop violence, characters and dialogue to maintain that comic book feel. Giving codirector status to creator Frank Miller and allowing him to write the screenplay was perhaps the wisest move director Robert Rodriguez ever made, because Millers gritty influence shines through, perfectly capturing the mood of his original creations.And the visuals... extraordinary. The entire film is shot in black and white, except for certain items which appear in colour. (a red dress, red blood, although sometimes the blood is stark white, and not to mention Nick Stahls character, Yellow Bastard, who is, indeed, yellow) Rodriguez is also smart enough to use a greenscreen backdrop, so as to recreate Millers gritty, moody sets by computer animation instead of trying to create them first hand. And it works, wonderfully  the sets perfectly set the tone for the rest of the movie: dark, bold, overthetop and quality work unlike any other. Add the characters noirish costumes (almost every male character sports, as Marv puts it, a damn fine coat) unique appearances, (it says a lot for the quality of the movie when a character like Yellow Bastard doesnt seem out of place) and movement (take note that if the movie was paused at any given point, the frame would look like a panel from a comic book) and Miller and Rodriguez perfectly nail the comic book feel.It also helps that a wonderful cast has been assembled to bring life to the mayhem. Spot on performances abroad here, but the standouts in my opinion were Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling as Kevin, the silent, cannibalistic serial killer; Nick Stahl as Roarke Junior/Yellow Bastard, a truly creepy and disgusting character; Clive Owen, playing against type as Dwight; (who isnt exactly a sophisticated, British gentleman, but then again, no one in this film is) Mickey Rourke as Marv, managing to turn out a stunning performance, even with his face buried under several layers of latex; Benicio Del Toro almost unrecognizable as corrupt cop Jackie Boy and a welcome appearance from Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, an enforcer specializing in inflicting pain. The hard edged ladies also do a great job, with Jessica Alba, Rosiaro Dawson, Carla Gugino, Jamie King and the rest all giving great performances.Its all in the style of such films as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, so it may be wise to use those films as guidelines of what to expect in terms of content. Its true that Sin City is not for everyone: the violence is brutal and unflinching, most characters are disreputable, manipulative and sleazy, and the whole feel of the film is undesirable, and not too cheery. But if none of that deters you, Sin City should be known as a must see, for the superb visual stylistics if nothing else. But the style and feel of the comic books is perfectly captured and thrust into our faces. Frank Miller must be proud.10/10",False
"4 childhood friends set out for petty prank that changes their lives forever.Sleepers, is a captivating, taut, ride. Its wellcrafted visually and storywise, keeping my attention from the first plot point to the last, which is hard to do, as I see dozens of movies each week. I cant believe I missed this back in 96.  It must have been the pedestrian title, but at any rate, the performances were topnotch and the story, both intriguing and heartwrenching.

Who cares if the story is true, the movie is entertaining and a fun ride!",True
"Stellar Sellers Melvyn Douglas as Ben Rand and Shirley Mac Laine as Eve Rand were only two examples of the great casting in this film. The best casting of course was to place Peter Sellers in the role of Chauncey Chance Gardener. I have watched this film many times and each time I see something else to enjoy in Peter Sellers performance along with something else to mourn for his passing. In Being There Sellers abandons the crowd pleasing slapstick which attracted the droves for the Pink Panther series to offer a far more sincere performance that to me is flawlessly incharacter and ultimately believable. I am constantly debating with myself whether Dr. Strangelove or Being There was Sellers best work. Being There is very enjoyable and I never seem to get tired of it. Apart from Sellers standout performance, Being There from every angle is an extremely well made film that holds up well to remain engaging 25 years later and is no doubt a source of pride for all involved in any regard. In short, this is a movie that, I like to watch!",True
"Quirky characters who eventually grow on you The shifty, funny/serious tone of Terms Of Endearment caught a lot of people off guard in 1983 and wordofmouth about it being a seriously good tearjerker/comedy was strong (opening near Christmas probably didnt hurt it come Oscar time either!). But since then, TV sitcoms have been mining this kind of flippant, edgy, raw sense of dynamics (Roseanne comes to mind), and Terms doesnt seem as fresh. Watching it again the other night, I couldnt help feeling some of the juice was missing, or that Shirley Mac Laines Aurora Greenway was actually more of an irritant than a sympathetic harridan. But on closer inspection, the lives of these characters are quite endearing, and the tender music on the soundtrack always underlines a poignant scene at just the right moment. Vivid Debra Winger is incredible as Mac Laines daughter, as are John Lithgow, Jeff Daniels, Jack Nicholson and, in a small but telling part, Danny De Vito. As for Mac Laine, I think she makes a few missteps in her characterization, and I didnt like the scene where she leaves her own birthday party in a huff and finds herself at Nicholsons doorit feels put onor her famous scene with Jack driving on the beach, which is highly improbable. However, her determined will and loving possessiveness/detachment towards her daughter makes her a complicated and colorful bundle of nerves. The picture is flawed, yet has scenes of worth and love, many memorable lines of dialogue, and shows a real skill for balancing different moods. *** from ****",False
"Inside the Head thats Inside the Head Greetings again from the darkness. Most movies fit pretty easily into a genre: drama, comedy, action, etc. This latest from film festival favorite Lenny Abrahamson is tough to classify. It begins with silly and funny innerdialogue from an aspiring musician/songwriter (Domhnall Gleeson), transitions into a dark dramady with complex characters and dialogue, and finishes as a bleak statement on mental illness and the music business.Thats more than I would typically disclose, but some have described the film as an outright comedy and I find that unconcsionable. If you are expecting a laugh riot, you will not only be disappointed, but are likely to miss the unique perspective provided.The screenplay is written by The Men Who Stare at Goats collaborators Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan. Clearly inspired by the late British comedian and musician Chris Sievey (and his character Frank Sidebottom), Mr. Ronsons work with Mr. Sievey is the driving force. Its also the reason Gleesons character is emphasized over Michael Fassbenders titular character who dons the paper mache head for the bulk of the movie. This script decision probably keeps the film from being truly great.The exceptional and attentiongrabbing first 15 minutes set up a movie that dissolves into an exploration of the creative process within mental illness ... Franks states numerous times that he has a certificate (certifiable). There is also an ongoing battle between art and commerce, as waged by Maggie Gyllenhaals character and that of Gleeson. Social Media power is on full display as this avantgarde performance art band gathers a huge following prior to ever really producing any music.Without seeing Franks facial expressions, we witness his transformation from mystic/guru to an unstable and socially uncomfortable dude striving for likability, but unsure what the term really means. Must artists suffer for their art? Why does society latch onto the newest social media gimmick? What is creative success and why are so many afraid of it? The film begs these and other unanswerable questions. Certainly interesting, but definitely not 90 minutes of laughter.",False
"Excellent family movie, and a fine storyI first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, Ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, hell crack an Oscar one day...Thats not to denigrate this film at all.Its a fine story, with very believable people (well, its based upon the authors early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast  Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping.But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster! What fun it was...I didnt achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But, thats what you find out when you see this movie.Sure, its a basic family movie, but thats a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids: youll all have a lot of good laughs.",False
"Outstanding acting performances worth price of admission I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.",True
